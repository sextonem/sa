I checked into the noisest lobby of my life ( not their fault if they have loud guests I suppose) The worst part was probably when I arrived at the room.........and it was OCCUPIED by other guests- Beds unmade- sheets ( dirty)  I immediately called the front desk who said a room was unavailable at the moment- and that we would need to wait an hour or two till one is cleaned up?  Worst part. Not a single person on the staff apologized to me or the guests in the room. Nightmare!!!

Nothing within reasonable walking distance. Thin thin walls and although I can usually sleep through anything it was hard to ignore the hall noise and noise from other rooms. It sounded as if there were people in the bathroom from sound travelling through the fan vent. Having the sink outside the tub and toilet area with no pivacy door is uncomfortable when travelling with someone. Privacy is nice sometimes. The room was tired.,3,negative
79574338,markham\ca\181720\181948\107186787.html,Staybridge Suites Toronto,"I stayed here during a weeknight in July with my wife and 2 year old son after a trip to the Toronto Zoo. We picked this hotel because it was relatively close to the zoo, and was reasonably priced.   The room was clean and spacious, and the kitchenette was great for travelling with a young child.   The issue that we had was that we had booked a room with 2 beds, but were given a room with a queen bed and a pullout couch. Not a huge deal, but our son was pumped about sleeping in a ""big bed"", and could tell the difference between the bed and the pullout. I told the front desk that we had booked a room with 2 beds, but he said that according to their system, we had booked a suite with a queen bed. Apparently there were no rooms with 2 beds available, so we were stuck with 1 bed and a pullout.  I had noticed a card in the room that said if you weren't 100% satisfied, to let the hotel know. When we got home, I filled out a form on the Customer Care section of the chain's website describing the mixup. I received a reply shortly after that, with an apology and a statement that the management of the hotel would contact me via email within 48 hours (If they didn't, I was to respond directly to the email). No contact was made. I replied to the email, and a week later received another, similar, response by someone else at guest relations. Needless to say, I have not heard anything from the management of the hotel.",3,negative

We asked about laundry facilities and were absolutely surprised that it was FREE and the machines did a great job! We needed to do some BBQ'ing one evening and we were allowed to use the BBQ's in the courtyard. Again FREE! Even though we didn't get a chance to enjoy the evening refreshments of baked macaroni and cheese or the BBQ, if the breakfast was any indication then I am sure it would have been delicious. Again FREE! The courtyard was beautiful and clean! The hotel was busy and full, but there was no noise from any other guests, even walking down the hall.

In the end, we were very pleasantly surprised with our stay here.   We had booked 2 rooms and were planning to have 2 people in 1 and 1 in the other, so after booking I emailed and requested 2 beds in 1 room if possible. I wasn't sure they would be able to grant this, since the 2 bed rooms normally are more expensive, but when we checked in they told us that both rooms had been upgraded to 1 bedroom suites with 2 beds each. The rooms were clean and very spacious--much more than what we needed, and they would be great for anyone there for a longer term stay.  We were basically just looking for a clean, comfortable place to sleep that included parking & breakfast, and Staybridge definitely offered that. The hotel was quite full the night we were there, including a large number of kids staying for a hockey tournament, so I was concerned about noise, but we didn't have any problems. It did mean that the pool was really full of kids in the evening.  The beds were a bit on the firm side for my taste, but it's also worth noting that I was more than 8 months pregnant during our stay so I'm a bit fussy about bed quality right now! I did discover that the couch was very comfortable, though.   The only oddity I found in the room was that the shower curtain was of the style that curves out from the tub, but the tub was standard size and the curtain did not reach very far down. The result was a pretty large puddle on the bathroom floor as water splashed out under the curtain.  Breakfast was fine for an included breakfast--the standard hotel fare (fruit, yogurt, breads, cereal, make your own waffles). The coffee was actually much better than average for a hotel, and even with the high occupancy there was plenty of food (we were there early).",4,positive

There were plenty of plates, glass containers with lids for use if you were planning on making your own dinner, or reheating any leftovers from the nearby resturants.

Areas for improvement: the room was clean but still found crumbs on kitchen counter and candy wrappers under the bed - the breakfast area is not replenished and cleaned up fast enough in the morning so some items will be missing (bananas or milk) and it looks dirty very fast + not enough room to sit in eating area although you can bring a tray to your room which is what we did - the breakfast time ends at 9:30am on weekdays which is quite early when you have teens and are vacationing - lots of sports teams hosted so it could get loud at times - dirty stairwell (wrappers probably left by youngsters). I would not necessarily shy away from staying here but I can say from experience that other such hotels/facilities are better run than this one so I invite management to make some adjustments if they want to stay competitive.

We wanted to be close to extended family who lived in Markham and wanted an economical stay as the flights were already horrendously expensive. Staybridge Suites was a very suitable choice for the following reasons a) the price was good 2) we got a one bedroom with two double beds and the living room area had a fold out couch so 5 of us can stay in one unit 3) complimentary breakfast with hot foods for 5 people for multiple days stay helped us cut down on food cost 4) kitchen with fridge, 2 stove elements, cookware, cutlery, dishwasher, microwave allowed us the ease and comfort of eating in suite or reheating food 5) free gym and wifi 6) reception on Tue, Wed and Thur with free appetizers and drinks from around 5:30pm. They even post a calendar on your fridge to let you know of the reception events going on as well as weekly wifi password changes.  Now the downside...the hotel is located in a business district in Markham (around CGI building area ) and can be hard to find. I personally took public transit from downtown Toronto and took 2 VIVA transit buses and walked 7 minutes to get here on $6.50 over two hours during rush hour. I called the hotel in advance for transit directions and they were extremely helpfu. The rest of my family came in and took cabs ranging from $50-70 from the airport and the taxi driver had to circle for some time to find the place. The place can easily blend into the nearby residential buildings and be mistaken for a condo building. Also, the furnishings and decor is a bit 90s dated but it did not seem to bother us at all.

When specificially asked about the impact of the construction on our guest room & our stay, we were reassured that the construction would only occur during 10am-5pm, that we would not be interrupted during the night or in the morning. What a lie! Every day, they turned off the water for an hour. On friday morning, before the 7am, we heard loud footsteps walking back and forth. We called the front desk and they stopped for awhile. Then at around 8am, we started to hear drilling noises right above our room. This is totally unacceptable, we paid for a 2 bed suites expecting to get a good night of rest, & were lied to about the construction hours. When we called front desk the second time, they told us that the construction workers weren't supposed to start yet. But hello?! There were drilling noises right above us, so I don't imagine it's just guests taking a drill and drilling holes into the walls. Then they proceed to tell us some lame story about the contruction workers having access and keys so to suggest they have no control of when the construction workers come in. I mean, if you're in hotel management and can't even manage the schedules of a few construction workers so that it won't interrupt the quality of the guests' hotel experience, how can you manage the entire operation of the hotel?   Aside from the construction, staff seems disorganized. It took more than a call to get toilet paper. I mean, the housekeeping staff came to make the beds, but didn't seem to restock toilet paper. When we called the front desk, they actually told us to come to the front desk to get toilet paper. Ok, alright. When we got to the front desk, the staff was looking everywhere to find toilet paper but couldn't find it. Then he told us to go back to our room and would send someone to bring it up for us. I understand we're not staying at a 5 star hotel, but we're not requesting for something extraordinary... just a basic roll of toilet paper. Was that so difficult?  At check out, although the guy Patrick seems sincerely apologetic, we were so upset that management didn't resolve the construction/noise issue properly & promptly and we vow to never stay at this staybridge again and will warn our families & friends from making the same mistake we did.

133926310,markham\ca\181720\181948\133926310.html,Staybridge Suites Toronto,"It is our annual summer trip to Toronto. I booked a 2 bedrooms suites for our travel group of 5. Once we walked into the hotel reception, we were nicely informed the hotel was currently undergoing a ""multi-millions"" renovation. While asking if the renovation would be impacting our stay, the receptionist told us that the construction would start from 10am-5pm and it should not really be affecting us. But everyday during the renovation hours - there could be no water in the room. I have no clue why they would think the renovation has no impact to their customers if there were certain hours that their guests could not enjoy their room with full amenity. The hotel did not mention in the time of booking of such situation so the only thing we can do was to deal with it. So every morning of our stay - the five of us had to make sure we finished washing up/shower before 10am while we should have no rush for whatever we were doing during our vacation!!! Because of that, we had to forego the idea to go back to the hotel in the middle of the day for a shower due to the crazy hot weather (95 degree+ ). So for the first 2 nights, we did pretty well to ""avoid"" all the convenience that caused by the hotel iteslf on its own renovation project. Again, this is not the way it should be.   The day of checking out was a Friday. The construction team started to bang the wall as early as 7:30am. It is like they were banging nails or something. We called immediately to complain as it was apparently they violated their renovation notice to their guests. So it took twice of the complaints to make them stop. It was already 8:30am and we were all woke up and could not continue to sleep anymore.   So we complained again when we were checking out. The receptionist - Patrick - cannot apologize enough for what we experienced in the morning while the other receptionist guy standing next to him - an asian man had a smirk on his face while listening to our conversation. So unprofessional! It is as if our complaint was a joke!!! There should be people from the management to take responsibility to apologize to the affected guest. The truth is that they mismanged the contractors and did not do their jobs right to make sure their guests are not disturbed by the renovation. In fact, one day I was going into an elevator and a moving guy rolled in a piece of furniture and he wanted me to hold on the elevator so he could roll the rest of the furnture on the corridor into the elevator!!! Maybe, I should also help to roll the furniture as well.   I would not stay in this place ever again though this stay is my returning trip. I am totally disappointed in the way we were treated that we had to pay a full price ($225+) while we lost all the flexibility to use our room during the day and endured the banging noise at so early while we have 12 hours of drive ahead of us that day. Next time definitely going to Sheraton and sure services and quality would be more guaranteed.",1,negative

Fortunately, Staybridge has availability, we booked at 8.30am on the 21st and the front desk checked us in at 10.30am. The top two floors have been renovated, they are doing the ground floor and common area now. Our room is nicely renovated, clean, bright, breakfast is wonderful. When we checked in on the 21st, it was our son's birthday. The hotel happened to have a ""Happy Birthday"" singing balloon in the lobby. We went to Wonderland that day until late, when we came back to our room, there was a beautiful birthday cake, with his name on it and a balloon in our room. We were completely taken by surprise. Thank you so much. We had stayed in the Staybridge Suites in Manhattan the previous week and was pleased with it, that's why when our original hotel didn't work out, we immediately switched to Staybridge in Markham. It didn't disappoint. The renovation did create a little inconvenience but the staff and the service more than made up for it.

The hotel is using the build of two high rise condo towers next door to update the hotel itself in a multi-million buck refit. Many of the rooms have been nicely refurbished. Alas, you may encounter wet paint, missing carpets and will certainly be aware of the 8 a.m. start for trucks and earth-movers. At this date, the action was in the hotel's own interior courtyard. If you have a low pain threshold, or will be in the room during the day, be advised.

Everyone was professional, friendly and helpful. When we left, the renovation was 99% complete. The area is safe and dog friendly. Our chocolate lab enjoyed daily walks throughout an adjoining neighborhood and chasing balls in the quiet park next door without the hassle of traffic.

From the moment we arrived, staff was overly accommodating and genuinely tried to make us feel comfortable. We couldn't believe the professionalism and courtesy the staff at Staybridge Markham had.  For actors or key creatives coming from out of town, I'd highly recommend staying at Staybridge Markham, as the suites are more geared to feel like an apartment! You have a sweet little kitchen and can make yourself feel very at home.  I have stayed at many hotels worldwide and am beyond impressed by the team at Staybridge Markham! They honestly make a memorable experience for guests - which you can rarely say about staying at a hotel for business! I'd highly recommend this location.  Although there was construction, it was not at all audible in the rooms - which by the way were also incredibly comfortable to stay in. When you go into the hotel, as well, there is a lounge area where coffee and tea, lunch, and dinner are provided for the guests - and you know what? It all tastes great. I could not have felt better about staying at Staybridge!

We initially intended to stay in downtown Toronto but were turned off by the parking and difficulty with parking -- we wanted a rental car rather than public transit. So we looked towards the suburbs. Staybridge is near both the 407 and the 404. 407 took us to Niagra Falls, while the 404 took us right into downtown which made the location ideal for everything we wanted to do. The rooms are clean and attractive. Having a small kitchen makes a big difference when you're traveling with family. We had a smaller suite which meant all one room but it was fine. I saw some complaints about road noise but I was hardly noticeable from our room on the 3rd floor overlooking the 407. We were also by the elevator but didn't notice hallway noise. They have a warm breakfast of eggs and sausage or eggs and bacon (changes daily) as well as fruit, bagels, a waffle machine, and yogurt. They also have snacks in the evening (tues/wed/thu) but we only made it on time on Nacho night so I can't speak to what they had the other nights. The staff was fantastic. Kim was very helpful prior to our stay by resolving a problem I had with my reservation which made a huge difference in our ability to enjoy the trip. Patrick also went above and beyond when one night we were looking for hot chocolate. They have coffee, tea, and usually hot chocolate in their common area off the lobby. When we got back one night, there was no hot chocolate. When I asked Patrick, he said they only had Apple Cider that night. So we went to our room. About 20 minutes later, we ran into Patrick in the hallway and he was on his way to our room with 3 mugs of hot chocolate he managed to find. We were not only surprised that he did this, but that he knew who we were when I hadn't even given our name when I asked about it earlier in the night. Both Kim and Patrick are examples of the high quality of service you'll find at this hotel.  It's a great value for the quality of service and location.

It wasn't until mid-afternoon that it was all cleaned out.  The two things that turn our experenice from good to bad is at the end of the trip. Since our flight won't depart until midnight, We keep asking if we could have a late checkout, one of the staff basically said no and did not offer any other alternatives, other two staffs promised to ask their manager and get back to me but no one did. Finally, one staff offer to let us stay till 8 p.m. with a half day price, which is fine, but it was not until I pushed for an answer on the very last day.  The other incident is that when we checked out on the evening of February 21, 2013, I broke one of my finger nail when moving the luggage. It was half hanging to my finger and I need a bandaid to avoid the nail from tearing off my finger (it was quite painful). Since we are on our way to the airport, we asked the front desk for ONE bandaid. The answer is... ""Sorry, we ran out of bandaid"".

We couldn't quite make it down to Florida so we did the next best thing - one night in Markham.  Anyway, for $131 we got a one bedroom suite with 2 double beds, breakfast and dinner (soup and sandwich) and the swimming pool to ourselves on 2 occassions.   The room: nicely decorated, ample room, clean and comfortable. The bathroom (toilet and shower) was a little tight but manageable. We didn't use all the amenities in the stocked kitchen but all the basics seemed to be there. The walls are a little thin, you can hear the water running from the next rooms.  The lobby and eating area were clean. The only negative comment would be that the serving area is quite tight where they have the salad area and waffle station. There is coffee and tea available during the day. Not sure how often they refill the coffee, though because coffee wasn't piping hot.  Breakfast was good - nothing spectacular. In the evenings (Tues., Wed. and Thurs.) a ""snack"" is served from 5:30 - 7:30. Although it's a ""snack"" it served as dinner for us. It saved us going out and probably saved us about $30 or so. It's a different menu during the 3 nights.  The pool area could use a little attention but it wasn't too bad. It was big enough that we could swim and splash around. We did see a cleaner cleaning the change/bathroom.  I appreciated the free use of washer and dryer. I happen to have had detergent but you can buy it from the hotel's convenience store.  We didn't have too much interaction with the staff, they were friendly enough during check in and out but they didn't go out of their way.   Although we couldn't check in early, we were allowed to use the pool and because I am Priority Club member, they let us check out at 2pm.   The hotel is close to lots of restaurants, especially Asian but lots of other choices too. It is also close to a major highway.  Because the hotel is in an area with lots of offices, I think the guests are mostly business people. That's probably why the pool was empty during the day. We did see some other families but I think the majority are business guests.   There are so many hotels in the area and to compete you have to go the extra distance to draw in guests and I think Staybridge did that with the suite, food and pool.

We arrived right at 3pm for check in and were greeted by a very pleasant and polite staff member at the front desk (I can't remember his name!) We parked around back and went up to our room. The room was only $112 plus tax, as we booked a few weeks in advance. We booked the one bedroom king suite and were very pleased with what we saw.  The room was spacious, bright and modern. It was also very clean. The kitchen was stocked with basic dishes: plates (small and large), bowls, large & small glasses, wine glasses, coffee mugs, a frying pan, two pots, a steamer basket, cutlery....also a toaster and a FULL SIZE coffee maker (we loved this, as every other hotel room we've stayed at has had a mini coffee maker!) Basically everything you need to cook a very basic meal. Full size fridge and a two-burner stove top rounded out the kitchen. One minor annoyance is that you have to set a kitchen timer on the wall in order to make the stove work (it took us a few minutes to figure out that the stove won't work without the timer on!) The timer has a sign that suggests you use it but it would have been helpful if it said that it needed to be activated before the stove would turn on.  I loved the way the living room was set up...instead of one large coffee table, this room came with three smaller tables that could easily be moved around as you needed them. We found this very convenient and appreciated this small detail. We also appreciated the fact that the television came with regular cable, instead of turning on a TV to find annoying advertisements for the hotel! Both the living room and bedroom came with a flat screen TV and the living room came with a small DVD player. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was the only part of the room that looked a bit outdated...the shower seemed a bit old and the tub was small.   The only complaint I have was that the walls were very thin, so we could hear a lot of noise from the surrounding rooms....furthermore (this part is not the fault of the hotel)....some of the other guests were, frankly, awful. There were a LOT of children in the hotel and the parents didn't seem to care that their kids were running back and forth through the halls (both on our floor and the floor above us), screaming and ""playing"". The guests in the room next to us also had very loud children. Having my bath interrupted by the sounds of screaming children was not pleasant. I find this behaviour completely unacceptable and I'm sure that we were not the only guests who had their relaxation disturbed by this. My mother would have flayed me alive if I had behaved like that in a hotel as a child!!   We didn't take advantage of the free breakfast so can't comment, but a free breakfast is always a bonus.

Great location for families visiting Wonderland (20-30 minutes), the Zoo (same), downtown museums. (To avoid confusion, this is not close to the airport, but is at the junction of Hwy 7 and 404, northeast of Toronto. It is in a very quiet residential neighbourhood and closer to many other attractions than if you stay near the airport, but still an easy drive to the airport in the morning and a much nicer area.)

We were like scared to death caused we heard people were fighting just right outside my room, also we heard there were more and more people came join their party. And we called the front desk even police couple times but no one comes to stop them! So we just can do nothing but stay awake over night and watch them through the door peek-hole to protect ourselves until 7am!!!!!   And in the morning, there's no apology from the manager, and he said, ""You don't need to complain us through fax or email because I'm the one who receive all the complaints."" After the trip, I even called Toronto Tourist, they can do nothing neither.

We were a total of 7 families staying at the hotel and they let us have a lte checkout. They also have a nice patio which we were able to have a nice barbecue because they provide you with that also. The pool was nice and it is right next to the patio so the adulta were able to keep an eye on the kids from close. When it got cold they let us borrow the main room and put on the hockey game for us, which was very nice of them. The room were nice but I had a problem with mine, it looked nice and clean when I got there but looking at the room more closely I came across nail clippings and then I came across an empty condom wrapper..GROSS!. They cleaned it up right away but there was no compensation for that. That upset very much, because I am rething if I should stay there next time. What else will I find??? The continental breakfast was not good, the omelletes and scarmbled eggs were dry and microwaved, the sausages were gross, they were sitting out too long, they should consider doing less amount at one time so it is fresh and not sitting out for too long.

Standard design for similarly ranked hotels but somehow it didn't give me a feel of openness, maybe because of its low ceiling right from the Main Entrance. The one bedroom suite was good for accommodating 4 people with the L-shaped sofa bed in the living room. The design of the bathroom door was a failure as it was so wide that it nearly touched the rim of the toilet which made it inconvenient for entry or exit.   Service was average. Upon return to our room on the second day, we found that the cleaning of our room was only half finished, it seemed that the housekeeping staff was called away or left half way through; amenities was not replenished and all mugs in the kitchen were gone.   Breakfast was average and service was routine. Hotel rates would be the factor for consideration of repeated stay.",4,positive

The continental breakfast was perfect, but if you stay more then two days probably best to get breakfast somewhere else as the food variety was the same, but it still was perfect for us. I have no complaints. The hotel is perfect for families. As the bedroom is separate from the main area. It was great to put the kids to bed and then watch a bit of TV without the walking the kids. The heated pool was great and the kids enjoyed it. It's a great location, close to most major amenities (shops, restaurants, grocery stores etc...).",4,positive

The hotel is just north of the border of the city of Toronto-conveniently located to a number of expressways and 25 minutes due east of the airport. We have stayed here on a number of occasions and return when possible because of the great value and proximity to family. The hotel has undergone a wonderful major renovation and check-in/out was smooth and effortless. My husband and me shared an 'accessible' room with my 93 year old frail mother. The room was perfect for my mom with all the necessary bathroom amenities for a frail adult. My husband and I were quite comfortable on the sofa-bed in the living room. Other famly members had 2-bedroom/bathroom suites that were spacious and comfortable. The included generous daily buffet breakfast was held in the spacious front reception area. It was a treat-with items to suit every possible taste and kid-friendly (waffles, eggs, sausage, fruits, cereal, oatmeal etc). A nice touch is the 24 hour tea/coffee available in the lounge. The staff were courteous and polite to a fault, and my husband enjoyed his swim in the larger than usual, heated indoor pool. There is ample parking, and the quiet suburban neighborhood allows for a pleasant stroll to a lovely nearby park where we saw abundant bird life including a blue heron. Two blocks north is the busy suburban Highway 7 and a cornucopia of asian-themed shops and restaurants. And all this-including a daily newspaper-for around C$120/night including tax for our room (higher for the 2 bedroom suites). Can't be beat.

Did not spend a lot of time at the hotel but there were no disappointments. It was what I’ve become used to with Staybridge Suites; friendly staff, very clean and quiet. The elevator at this one seemed a bit slow but provided a good excuse to take the stairs. Carpet in the stairwells looked like it might be starting to wear but it was still very clean.  Didn’t take advantage of the dining room this time, but if it’s anything like the Guelph location, it’s a very nice added bonus.

167477735,markham\ca\181720\181948\167477735.html,Staybridge Suites Toronto,"We were very disappointed by our recent stay at this hotel. We had previously stayed here and been very pleased, but we will never book here again.  First, the breakfast buffet was good but very overcrowded. The way it is laid out causes a lot of ""traffic jams"" and even makes it hard for staff to put out items.   The room itself was very spacious and great for a family as we could make meals. It was clean and equipped with anything we might need.   However, on the second evening we stayed there, we came back to the room and the water level in the toilet was very high. We figured something must be clogged and didn't want to flush it just in case so we asked for (and received promptly) a plunger. We used it and the water level retreated and we thought no more of it. Just before bed, we heard a lot of ""gurgling"" from the toilet and realized the water level had crept back up so we repeated the process and headed to bed.   Unfortunately, while we were sleeping, the toilet overflowed everywhere. (This was before the flooding in Toronto and not related). There was a good inch of water in the bathroom, in the hallway with the sink and the carpet on one side of the bed was soaked. We also had one bag that was at the end of the bed that got wet and ruined some of our souvenirs from our trip. We called and they were very prompt about cleaning it up however the carpet remained soaked for the entire rest of our time (1 night/2 days left). We were not given another room as they claimed the hotel was fully booked. We asked if they could try a wet vac or the like and nothing was ever done. I would even have been happy with a fan to help dry it out a bit! I ended up having to put towels down so we could walk to the bathroom and not get our feet wet, and they didn't last long before they would be soaked as well.   In the end, the customer service was sorely lacking when we needed it most, and we will not be returning to this hotel.",3,negative
167792904,markham\ca\181720\181948\167792904.html,Staybridge Suites Toronto,"Yup, that's right - don't use hotwire for 3+ people for this location. The difficult thing being that's the whole gimmick about hotwire - you don't know what hotel you're getting until the transaction is complete. Don't get me wrong - I'm not slamming this hotel - very courteous staff - clean rooms - perfect location. Long story short - using hotwire, I specified 4 people - I then got this particular location as my hotel but it indicated for me to contact the hotel about bed types. I recommend you do not email the hotel - they don't check their email or they don't reply - not really sure what's going on there. Anyways, I found out my room would be 1 queen bed with 1 sofabed. Very annoyed, I pleaded with the hotel that this was unacceptable and they blamed hotwire for the fashion they market their hotel. I was offered a room with 2 double beds for an additional $30 but I refused. I then contacted hotwire, ironically they blamed Staybridge and that it's up to the hotel to deem what's adequate accommodations for the number of specified guests. It became an argument of is a sofa bed adequate - in no shape or form do I believe so...I'd rather sleep on the carpet than a sofabed. As you know hotwire doesn't do refunds or transfers so I was a bit stuck. I figured I'll go to the hotel in person and plead my case again face to face. The woman was very nice and understanding but stated she didn't have any control over hotwire's way of business - she did offer the upgrade of $10 for 2 double beds and I had no choice but to accept. I very much enjoyed our room - very clean and spacious. I'm not a big fan of the bathroom sink being in the open but no big deal. It's awesome having the kitchen (with fridge) as we had a ton of groceries to keep cool. I would stay here again for sure but only for 2 people...in my opinion - 4 people need 2 queen beds.",4,positive

169242499,markham\ca\181720\181948\169242499.html,Staybridge Suites Toronto,"We chose this hotel for our family of four (kids are ages 5 & 2) because it was in between the two attractions we were in town for - the Toronto Zoo and Canada's Wonderland. Staybridge Suites was the only hotel in the area that had everything we were looking for: a suite with a separate bedroom with a door (so we could put the kids to bed and still stay up and watch TV, talk, etc.), two beds in the bedroom, a pool and complimentary breakfast. You did have to walk through the bedroom to get to the bathroom so that was not ideal - a little noisy while they slept. The bathtub and toilet are in their own tiny room (door barely clears the toilet) with very little lighting.   The bedroom was cozy. We had requested a crib. I called and asked if it would fit in the bedroom and was told yes, it was really a pack and play. There wasn't one in there when we arrived, but I have no idea how it would've fit anyway - unless you put it in the hallway of the bathroom. Luckily, our 2 year old slept in the bed well. Everything was very clean and pretty up-to-date and the staff was very friendly.  We did have an issue with our door lock - it didn't close and latch automatically. You really had to pull/push it. So when we returned from a full day out, we found housekeeping had not closed it tightly and it had been unlocked all day. Luckily, nothing was taken. We let the front desk know and they apologized and told us they would have it fixed the next day (when we were checking out anyway).   While the hotel was fairly close to the zoo and CW (20-30 min with traffic), we had a lot of trouble getting to the hotel. It's in a remote/residential area and I think the directions sent with the confirmation are not quite accurate - it's not the 4th left you take off of Highway 7. Also, there was construction going on at night on Hwy 7, so it took us over an hour to get off the exit from the 401 and go 4 blocks. If there is an alternate route, like going on a parallel street to Hwy 7 and cutting across, that would save you a ton of time.   The breakfast was decent (the waffle station was great, the egg things with the cheese that wasn't melted, not so great, but this is more than you'd expect at a continental breakfast). All in all, this was a nice, clean hotel with many amenities and we wouldn't hesitate to stay there again (hopefully when there is no construction).",4,positive

We booked a few nights online at this place in preparation for a special event. A member of our party had booked a few rooms for other family and friends for a couple of nights as well. Apparently the website was affiliated with Expedia. The rooms were prepaid (paid for at the time of booking).  When we arrived and tried to check in, we were told that a room was not available, and that they had arranged for us to stay at the Holiday Inn Express, about 5 minutes away by car. The girl at the reception was overly cheerful and did not seem to understand that it was a great inconvenience for us to go to this hotel, away from our family and friends, and then pack up all of our stuff and return to the hotel the next day. The apology was felt to be insincere. Meanwhile, the guests ahead of us were treated to a welcome bag! The staff also claimed that they paid for our night at the Holiday Inn Express, but it was really a transfer of the funds that we had already paid!  We were essentially downgraded from what we had booked. They stated that there was nothing they could do. When we asked what the reason was for bumping us, she mumbled that it was due to water damage. We feel that they overbooked. We also found out later that evening that a couple of our friends checked in at around the same time as we did without any problems.  The next day, we checked in again, and we were thankfully able to get a room. Members of our party also checked in to their rooms. When one of the members asked the staff at the reception if there was anything they could do to compensate us, the man said no. Not even an upgrade or a credit for a future stay. He stated that the hotel was sold out. He really seemed unconcerned and dismissive about our bad experience. He seemed more concerned about getting our signatures and a credit card. When one of the members went to her room, the door would not open with the key card. We asked a staff member if he could help us, and he tried with his key card. It did not work either and he stated that he would get her another room immediately, which he did. Really? I thought that the place was sold out. Apparently not!  Finally, when we checked out, my husband spoke to a different person at the reception desk. He might have been a manager. I had seen him at breakfast. My husband told him about our experience, and the manager laughed. I thought that this was absolutely unacceptable.   In summary, the place is fine to stay at, and the breakfast is fine too. However, the poor customer service really surprised me, and disappointed me. Being a Canadian, which I am really proud of, and staying in a Canadian establishment, I really expected more. Mostly, a sincere apology would have been appreciated. Some attempt to compensate us for the inconvenience would have been a bonus, and great for a return visit and recommendations to others. Unfortunately, such poor customer service has resulted in this review. We will not return to the Staybridge Suites of Toronto-Markham.

Highway 404 was in close proximity. The drive to toronto was about 20-40 minutes depending on the traffic. The suite in the hotel was great we had a two bedroom with a full kitchen, with three tv's. We were very comfortable watching dvd's and hanging out. The breakfast buffet was good, different foods each day. The only complaint we had was the pool. My husband and daughter went swimming without warning right before they came in to swim a little girl vomited in the pool and there was no sign to tell them not to swim because of it. My husband and daughter got warned after the fact from another guest that happened to witness the girl throwing up in the pool. When my husband called the front desk they were not concerned they said they would put up a sign I don't know if they did or not. Overall the price was not bad with all of the amenties. We would stay there again but we would have second thoughts about swimming in the pool. good for families and business. We couldn't hear the people next door. They had a dog and we only heard the dog in the late morning or evening which did not bother us.",4,positive

Still it was comfortable but the one bedroom has the Air Conditioning unit in it and it was VERY noisy. The unit was functioning OK but it was not engineered to be IN a bedroom and why the designer placed it there is a mystery.   The swimming pool is MICRO-sized and is actually in a remote building, which would make for interesting people watching in the dead of winter as they negotiate the cold outside while wet.  The breakfast was free and standard fare. Only ""pastry"" were dry scones. No bacon. Still it was tasty and satisfying.  Staff was very friendly and helpful in answering questions.

We live in two different cities and don't regularly get together so we planned to have dinner in our suite so we could get caught up on all our news. We brought in our own food and refreshment so, while we didn't do any cooking, per se, having the fridge and the stocked kitchen came in handy. The rooms were large, clean and well appointed.

The second night we used the sofa bed mattress on the floor instead of on the sofa bedframe. A bit better. Sofabed may work for smaller children who don't weigh much. Front desk staff were very pleasant. Breakfast provided a big selection with the standard breakfast fare (pre-fab sausages and eggs) but more topping for waffles and cereal. It was very nice overall. Breakfast runs til 10:30 on the weekend which was appreciated by teens. Didn't use the pool, but it looked nice. (just ran out of time). Check out time of noon is better than the 11:00 that most hotels have. Hotel is a bit isolated in a residential area, so nothing to walk to...need to have a car.

Staybridge amenities were free breakfast daily as well as dinner on weekdays, daily newspaper, business center/printer, gym, indoor heated pool, laundry and coffee or tea available anytime. All those perks for free!  The only downside is that their website mentions a free shuttle for the GO train station 5KM away on their direction page. That has now changed and it is not available. Not sure whether it is during high season only that they offer that perk. If you happen to be in Markham for whatever reason though, I'd highly recommend renting a car. You won't regret it.

Although the hotel hidden in a commercial area but if you just drive 5 minutes, everything is on Hwy 7 from restaurants, groceries, dessert, to movie theater it’s only 5 – 10 minutes away. For those who doesn't drive, exit out of the hotel to the left hand side 10 - 15 minutes’ walk to Hwy – McDonald, popeyes, Tim Horton’s, bubble tea, First Markham plaza with many varieties of restaurants including a LCBO.  We stayed in the queen studio suites. To my surprised, the room is spacious (enough for three adult + suite cases). Continental breakfast (complimentary) it’s as good as it gets; eggs, waffles, hot sausages, many choices of cereals, varieties of juice, and Wolfgang’s coffee. The layout/setup of the breakfast might need to rearrange specially the toaster and the waffle maker (congested- should be around the same area as the coffee, away from the crowd). The dining area is large enough, there’s always space for everyone. Free laundry great bonus for those who have kids, free wifi , staff are friendly, kitchen have enough items to cook-including a dish washer, DVD player – at the front desk there are some DVDs to borrow (guest should learn to return the dvds so that others can use).

Rooms were exceptionally clean and there was a kitchen which was really nice for those who love to cook and plan to stay for more than a night. We did use the pool which was clean and my son did have fun. In the morning, breakfast was yummy and their breakfast area has TV's everywhere.

The room was very nice, clean, modern, and had more amenities than I could have required - and all for a great price. The HVAC worked perfectly, and was easily adjustable... internet is very fast and easy to access... washroom is in good condition and has good shower pressure. The faucets were quite new and worked like a charm. Bed was very comfortable, TV had many channel options (some in HD), and even had a decent view of the nice neighbouring community.   The breakfast is the best breakfast I've ever had at a hotel - it puts a certain other brand (looking at you HIE) to shame... the eggs are great quality, there is fresh cut fruit, plenty of options, and the menu even changed daily. The highlight of the week was the french toast... my god it was good! Kudos to the breakfast cooking team - I was very impressed.  The ONE gripe I have with this location is the gym/fitness room. It is not very extensive, which is understandable due to the size of the area, but what made it painful was 50% of the machines were broken or poorly maintained. I almost sliced my hand on one of the tension wires which had been snapped and pulled askew. The exercise bike is completely broken, and there was only 1 working treadmill. It was unfortunate as I like to have a fitness room during my week long stays, so I had to go to another gym at night.   Other than the gym the area exceeded my expectations and I was very happy with my stay.

The hotels in downtown were either booked solid or overpriced.

What a great choice.  Arrived during the evening and the check in was fast and efficient. As an IHG member, we were upgraded to a 2 bedroom king suite. The room was great even though we only used the one bedroom, living room and kitchen area.  We had ordered take out from a local restaurant and given the time it was suppose to arrive, we decided we had time for a swim in the indoor pool. We passed by the lobby on the way to the pool and advised the staff that we had ordered delivery in the event they came early. The indoor pool was a good size, the room was heated very nice and the water was an excellent temperature. Sure enough, as we were enjoying our swim, one of the staff was nice enough to come to the pool area and advise us that our delivery had arrived early. Very impressed with the staff as they did not have to do this.  After a great night's sleep, we took in the buffet breakfast that was included. A very good selection of food and they had an awesome fresh fruit salad made up, simply delicious! We then checked out and it didn't take us anymore than 25 minutes to get to downtown Toronto.

Once we stayed there, we were surprised how this is made into the #1 spot!   The suite that we were in was not bad!  Out of the 4 nights we stayed there, the maid came over to clean the rooms only once! There is no maid service on the weekends and on a holiday you have to make a request. Even worse is we didn’t get the rooms cleaned even after requesting for it at the front-desk. With kids around, it’s not that easy to maintain the rooms clean for more than a day or two.  As soon as we stepped in to the room, we found out that one of the TV remotes didn’t work. On our way to dinner, we mentioned this to the lady at the front desk and the first question she asked was ‘did you turn the power button on?’ I said we tried everything and it looks like batteries are dead, but she asked us to make sure to click on the power button. I have to come down again to get the batteries!  Evening snack is free but there were 2 ladies from the front-desk area that used come and check everybody suspiciously : what is grabbed and/or how much… (at least that is what it looked like). No problems during breakfast trough.  During the checkout, the lady that was helping to print out our receipts, was coughing on the sheets directly! Hello, where is common sense?  There was a note stick on to the fridge that said ‘don’t forget to ask for your free gift from Coca Cola when you check out’. My son saw these brown bags with Coke logo on them at the counter during our checkout and so asked if he can get one of those and the response was ‘no we don’t have them anymore!’ So rude!!

The rooms are great and feel like home. There are a variety of different kinds of rooms, I would definitely recommend spending the little extra for a 1 bedroom since there is a lot of extra room. At this hotel, you get things like a full kitchen with full size fridge, free laundry, and a nice free breakfast with a lot of variety. Hotel was very clean and staff is very friendly, they almost always say hi when you pass them in the hall and were great at check in and out. The hotel is also a lot cheaper than other hotels in the area that offer less. Of course everything wasn't perfect, the room I was in on my last trip was between a storage room and loud family and it was kind of noisy. Also one of the staff was very controlling of the breakfast room. I think she meant well but could seem pushy at times. One of the washers was broken and I had to wait a while to get my clothes into the other machine, but I can't really complain since it is free. Overall, I would recomend this hotel and definitely stay here again. Staybridges are great for extended stays as I spent two months in one before.",5,positive

But I was very disappointed with my stay. The room was very small. It was a studio room and a family of 3 could hardly fit in. The hotel is next to 407 Expressway and the sound proof was not very good. All night we could hear cars and trucks buzzing. We tried to change the room the next day, but could only manage another room with the same problem. So stuck with the same room. The location of the hotel is good. Very close to 407 and 404. Breakfast was decent. Also used the business PC and printer. They did have snacks in the evenings, but we never went that way!! I will not recommend this hotel for light sleepers due to the poor sound proofing. Another disappointing factor was the Wireless internet speed. It was pathetically slow. So slow that we stopped using it. The thermostat was a very old fashioned one, but to my surprise, it was working very well. Overall, I would give 1 out of 5. Stay away if you can .

When we first arrived and went to check in at the hotel, the person at the customer service desk was not there. He was outside smoking a cigarette. When he came inside, his entire self smelled horrible with the smell of smoke.....meanwhile there were numerous non-smoking signs placed all over the building.  Then they placed us in a room next to the exit where there was constant noise throughout the entire two nights we spent there. The air condition unit was also very noisy and didn't work properly. There was also a very loud noise from an equipment shutting on and off which kept us up for most of our stay. The other issue was that the placed us in a room on the first floor where the huge flood light from out side shined right into the room the entire night, even with the blinds closed, it was difficult to sleep.  We went the person at the front desk after our first night there and asked us to be moved to another room, his response was, he'll see what he could do when his colleague came in and let us know, until now, we never heard from him again.  I had stayed at this hotel prior on a business trip earlier this year on the fourth floor which at that time wasn't so bad, so I decided to give it a second chance. I travel quite frequently to Markham numerous times per year on business, and I will never go back to this hotel. I left even more tired than when I got there. Just an awful visit.",2,negative

We did find the room tight on the sides of the bed (which was a double, not a queen). Having a fridge in the room was helpful along with the few plates and cutlery for snacks.   Breakfast in the morning was standard fare - sausages, scrambled eggs, fruit, waffles, muffins, toast, etc. They did have cold boiled eggs as well. We noticed in the morning they had difficulty keeping up with the crowd of people and the layout of the breakfast area made it difficult for people to move around the food selection. A nice feature was the ability to have a tea or coffee later in the day or night.   Room service - they cleaned the rooms and restocked the shampoo and conditioner every day.   We didn't use the pool or other facilities as we spent our time in downtown Toronto seeing the sights. The location of this hotel is a little way off the highway, in a residential area.

Kitchen facilities were good..some condiments provided, coffee maker, toaster, microwave, small stove top and ice maker (noisy!) in the fridge. Modern, tasteful furnishings with a comfortable bed.  This hotel is just over 2 kms away from the Shouldice Hernia Hospital with a quick and easy routeleading directely to the Hospital It is also located near Hwy 7 and several freeways and a short distance from a good selection of restaurants and coffee shops. Shouldice Hernia  However, because of the location to major roadways.. traffic noise was noticeable in the room, but it did not hinder me personally from a good nights sleep.  The noise from the bathroom fan (did not shut off) and air conditioner however were a bit more annoying.  This hotel only provides light housekeeping unless you request otherwise. That means the garbage is emptied, towels changed and the bed loosely made. Unfortunately I did not read the notice about the housekeeping till my last day and put up with an unvacumned room, toss pillows left on the floor, dirty bathroom sink, etc. If staying for more than a few nights I'd suggest taking advantage of extra housekeeping! A breakfast buffet is offered in the mornings, with slight variation each day. Good selection and great coffee provided all day! There is also a free supper buffet during mid week which I did not take advantage of. I noticed that the charge for my room increased mid week...thus making me question if the supper buffet was really ""free"". Would perhaps also suggest taking advangtage this buffet to offset the extra charges. This hotel seemed popular with families with small children and is pet friendly.  Ample free parking provided and there is also a pool which I did not unfortunately use.  Front desk staff were curtious and very helpful with suggestions and directions.

After sometime the house keeping lady came back and said it was ready. So we went to our room and found it large enough to fit our family of 5. When I went to pull out the coach I noticed that there was popcorn and kleenex under it. I moved the wooden stool in front of the coach and my hand stuck to it. So I called the front desk to have someone to come and clean it while we were at supper. When we came back it was clean....I guess.

The first night we found out that the pull out couch did not have blankets or sheets for it. When we called the front desk they said they did not have any for us. Kind of hard to accept that answer especially when the hotel set up for people that are staying a long time. We had to take the comforter covers off the end of the two beds so that my sons had something to sleep on. This was totally unsatisfactory. We decided to use the outdoor barbecues but there was only enough propane for one barbecue. Therefore we had to wait because the people before us was cooking about 30 pounds of lamb. When my wife and I were getting ready for bed we found licorice on our floor that obviously had been there previously. We also found a glass case in the couch. Both items were returned to the front desk just so they knew I wasn't making it up. The bigger issue was that when we went to eat we found out that the room did not have enough plates or glasses or silverware for 6 people although the room can sleep 6 to 8 people.I have stayed in a lot of sweets over the years and this hotel is definitely lacking amenities for people who want to cook their own meals.and me where the hotel is right next to highway 407 and can be loud for people who want to sleep with their windows open. Overall our experience at the hotel was disappointing considering the price per night of approximately $200.because this hotel caters to people who are staying a long time. It is disappointing to see that the smoking area is exactly where people have to come in and out of the hotel. Having a smoking area at the front door is just unbelievable.

It was very easy! We parked in Municipal Parking at the corner of Dudas and Yonge Street( where the city stage was) and at the end of the night we only payed $8 for parking that entire night! You couldn't have been more central downtown if you tried. It was perfect! The next morning we woke up to a very nice complementary breakfast.

Finally at 11 pm we had asked the Front Desk if we could be moved to a different location of the hotel. The front desk staff was quick to move us into another room, however we were very disappointed that it was no longer a King sized bed, as that is what we had booked and paid for. The front desk staff explained to us the all of the King Studio Suites were in the same area of the hotel - we never did find out what this noise was. Heating system possibly?  The breakfast was just ok. They were offering cheese omelettes and sausage disks. The sausage were a little crispy, and the eggs were not very warm.

The room featured a full kitchen with fridge, micro, and dishwasher. The front desk staff was very helpful with maps, directions, and dining recommendations.

The hotel is located near an upscale residential neighborhood with playgrounds, but is also convenient to the highway, restaurants, and shopping.

For what you pay, you get a lot more with Staybridge than just about any other hotel. The space, the breakfast, the parking, the wifi--no complaints here. The only issue we ran into was at breakfast, there's a rather crotchety Asian lady that stands behind you and scowls, no joke! I went to reach for a muffin without realizing that there were tongs to use and she clapped her hands at me. It makes for an awkward breakfast!

244980331,markham\ca\181720\181948\244980331.html,Staybridge Suites Toronto,This hotel has friendly staff and spacious rooms. We were in Markham on business and the internet was solid throughout the stay as well.  Room The rooms were large and the kitchenette would be nice for those who want to make their own meals.There is a desk available for working and convenient plug-ins for laptops/phones etc.  Food The free mini-supper during the week was nice to come back to. The breakfast was pretty good and included waffles and eggs and yoghurt.  Location It is located very near the 407 which makes for a quick 25 minute trip from the airport. There are a number of restaurants located within a 5 minute drive from the hotel as well.  Overall  This is a good spot to stay. Free breakfast and good internet make it a great choice for business travel.,4,positive
247585922,markham\ca\181720\181948\247585922.html,Staybridge Suites Toronto,"My girlfriend came to visit from Florida for New years and we stayed at the staybridge for a couple of nights before leaving town for New Years Eve.   The room was quaint, cozy and clean. However, you may encounter a little noise if you happen to stay next door to a family of screaming kids.   We got the one king bedroom suite which includes a living room area with a sofa, TV & even a DVD player. The kitchenette includes a dish washer, sink, fridge and hot plate for frying or boiling. It also includes plates, bowl, glasses, utensils as well as pots & pans if you want to make your own meal.  The bedroom was a little small but the king sized bed is comfy. The bathroom was excellent and well stocked.  The property is in a suburban surrounding and is just minutes from the 407. Fitness center, 24 hr convenience store, lounge, meeting rooms,laundromat and swimming pool all on site.  I will definitely recommend this place to anyone.
 
 
 Room Tip:  Feel free to bring along some DVD's. The room includes a DVD player :)

Microwave, stove, full-size fridge and freezer, toaster oven, dishwasher, 3 televisions with cable, good parking, and temperature controls that work. The layout of the suites was also nicely done. A definite must for the business or family trip.",5,positive
2521243,markham\ca\181720\181948\2521243.html,Staybridge Suites Toronto,"We chose the Staybridge for the last 3 nights of our holiday in Canada and it proved a great choice. It is perfect for a family as the suites have plenty of space and all the comforts of home in fact more TVs than I have at home!  Everything was efficient and friendly from check in to breakfast. The breakfast buffet (included in the rate) offered the most flexible approach to breakfast I have seen. You had a good range of 'continental brakfast' items plus two hot items that varied each morning. You could eat in the dining area, take a tray or brown bag back to your room, eat on the patio or, as I am sure I saw a few people doing, make you picnic for the day ahead.  They also offer late-afternoon 'sundowner' snacks, but we were never in the hotel to take advantage of it.  The guests were an interesting mixture of holidaymakers and business people. To those business people I apologise if my kids were a little boisterous!  We used it as a base for Canadas Wonderland and the Ontario Science Centre. Each took a whole day (and more). The hotel provided the tickets for Canadas Wonderland at a small discount and it meant no queueing at the park (well worth the price by the way).  The staff had a great knowledge of the surrounding areas and clear maps and directions were available for all the popular places.  The only minor drawback of the hotel is that it backs onto highway 407. This is intrusive at the back of the hotel and the patio, but otherwise is always present but you don't notice after a while.  Would I go back? Happily and without a doubt.",5,positive
252636147,markham\ca\181720\181948\252636147.html,Staybridge Suites Toronto,The staff seemed nice but the hallways and common areas were not terribly well cared for. Our room seemed okay but just before we checked out we found a glove from a previous guest beside the far side of the bed - ick!   Breakfast was average - we ate from paper plates and bowls which seemed odd and bit environmentally unfriendly. We forgot something in the room but no one seemed able to locate it when we called and it took 4 phone calls to get a call back...  Not the worst place we have stayed but definitely not the 10 they ask you to rate them.,3,negative
253822963,markham\ca\181720\181948\253822963.html,Staybridge Suites Toronto,"We spent an overnight in a 2 bedroom suite recently. Here's what I liked...  - Staff let my family stay in the lobby as they arrived a bit early before our room was ready. I was joining them a bit later as I was already in town on business. Once the first available room came up they were able to get in to it. That was appreciated.  - Having the pool is always great.  - Free parking is a bonus  - Wifi signal was great  Here's what was just ok...  - The breakfast. I don't expect much from hotel breakfasts and this like most was just ok. Everything came from a can, a bag, or was cooked/thawed in a microwave.   Here's what was not good  - The beds while comfortable were really really dirty. We found stains and a lot of hairs that weren't ours in our bed. We didn't even look at the kids beds as we didn't want to freak them out. That was pretty shocking. I've stayed in a lot of hotels both good and bad and this was literally the first time that something like this has been bad enough that I noticed it and was grossed out by it.   - The phones. We were trying to call the front desk for a late checkout and I discovered that the phone in our room wasn't even plugged in. The one in the living room was sticky and had food (?) particles stuck to it and the buttons to get the different lines didn't work so I couldn't call out on it. Needless to say I gave up and we left at that point.  I know you get what you pay for but I will have to say I expected better from this hotel. Sadly it's likely the next time we do a family trip to Toronto we'll likely look for somewhere else to stay.",3,negative

It was also great to have wine glasses , plates and a dishwasher in the room. The living room was large enough and comfortable so we could watch the DVD - ""Sex and the City"", of course. The breakfast was also everything we wanted and more. Fresh cut up fruit, yogurt, lots of coffee, juice, eggs, pastries, make-your-own waffles and breads. We will be staying here again next year.  I booked online and got a rate of $150 which we all felt was a deal considering everything we received.

The bedroom was a good size with two double beds and a second tv. The pool area is very nice; needs a hot tub though! The free breakfast was really good.

Great fresh breakfast and sandwiches in evening Tuesday-Thursday. Very noisy as many families travel here for events.

The bedroom also had a flat screen TV and a large dresser and mirror. We loved the color scheme of brown and turquoise. The buffet style breakfast the next morning was more than adequate with scrambled eggs and sausage patties, bagels, fruits, cheese, cereals and you could make your own waffles if desired.

Lots of families staying at the same time but noise level was very low to darn right quiet. Breakfast was included and had enough choices (hot, cold and healthy) to satisfy the appetite and get your day started right.   I had one issue with my hotel keys not working and despite my recommendation for them to investigate the lock itself, they didn't rush to fix the problem. It was a minor inconvenience but in the moment, I was frustrated that I had to go back down to the desk to explain my problem as I couldn't get into the room.

Booked here as it is close to all the same amenities. like the location as beside the 404 and 407 for as easy a commute as you can get in Toronto without being stiffled by the big downtown.......also being in the residential area gives the oportunity to go for walks in a family type settins.....probably more secure......Last time I was there it was beginning to show some wear........happy to say the place looked good, seem to have done some upgrading and the overall maintenance and cleanliness was better.....service checking in was quick, friendly and courteous......staff aim to please.....suite was clean as well.....enjoyed my stay......close to all kinds of restaurants for all budgets......great for long stays or small families touring the area with kitchen, sitting area, bedroom and bathroom......like a small apartement......the area has sure built up....breakfast served early enough for early starters......evening food as well........need more info visit their website

275519897,markham\ca\181720\181948\275519897.html,Staybridge Suites Toronto,"actually this was my first time at this IHG group hotel. The room was fully designed and furnished like a country home, complete with a full size fridge, a kitchen, an L-shaped couch, spacious room & bathroom; everything was comfortable. In addition to free breakfast, there was a free light buffet dinner on some nights (I stayed thursday). Staff were all friendly and i liked and avail'd of the free Laundry facility ($1ea for detergent and dryer bounce sheets though). Price was more affordable than my regular nearby holiday inn express and the location was convenient. Would stay again.  Regarding your environmental & health footprint and messaging:  Consider offering primarily VEGAN plant based foods & lifestyles in your restaurant and on signs for the guests if you really want to make an impact on the environment while offering the healthiest foods possible to your guests; My family and i would sure appreciate more Vegan chocies in the breakfast (and dinners)  Thanks for the unlimited, easy Free-Wifi on multi-devices. <<-- MUCH appreciated. :) THANKS, will consider coming back here again.

275842004,markham\ca\181720\181948\275842004.html,Staybridge Suites Toronto,"We had a a very spacious suite with a bedroom with 2 queens plus a living room and kitchenette. The sofa folds out to sleep two more. The buffet is above average from other mid end tourist hotels with omelets, french toasts and other main entrees that change daily. There are lots of tables to sit at so it's not a problem to come down for breakfast during peak time. There's even free dinner on some weeknights. Nothing too fancy, burgers, etc.  A few minor cons:  The buffet service is in a separate room from the dining room and it's small. It can be cramped in there while getting your breakfast.  You can sort all your garbage into different bins but the maids just dump them all together.  The rooms in the back face hwy 407. It's far enough and as long as your window is closed, the noise will not be heard. Alot of the washing machines and dryers are broken down. It can be a nuisance if you need to stay for an extended time there.

Cons are that for the price it is it not worth the cost we were offered a dinner buffet tuesday to thursday and on a one of these days a group was staying at the Hotel ,now the serving area is small and with this group it was tight on top of the attitude, Complained to the staff at the front desk and the attitude was are we supposed to not let them in . Other then that the Housekeeping was poorly done.

Usually I don't give 5 points in any of my reviews because there is always something to improve, but in this case I am giving 5 points, because it is really difficult to make it better. The room is incredibly spacious and well equiped, including 3 TVs and a good quality Bedware and bathware. The room has details dificult to find in other long stay hotels, like paper towels, dishwasher soap, and even salt. At the patio there is a beautiful fireplace and a covered swiming pool. There is a well equiped fitness center and laundry for free. At the breakfast there is a wide variety of well served food. There is also good seating area. Wide parking space.

Remembered my call earlier today requesting a quiet room even when your pms was down. Friendly and authentically caring and professional Attention General Manager: The other male front desk agent does not look you in the eye, he does not smile. Instead he calls out loudly, ' I will take you over here'. I suggest a retain for this agent to learn from Allison on how to engage guests as guests versus a never ending line of people to check in  Fellow travelers: clean rooms, quiet if you request the street side and located close to the 407 and wonderfully situated close to a large corporate office area and residential houses.  Very impressed, hoping that the GM sits down with the ale agent who was on tonight to learn from Allison on how to be professional versus blunt and impersonal. My guess is that this agent has no inkling of how mediocre their customer service experience is.   I would definitely stay here again and am super happy with a large suite that is spotless, offers quiet a/c and lots of electrical plugs. . . . . . great king size bed too.

In searching for a suites hotel close to Canada's Wonderland, this property came up as only 7km away but it's really 20. Because of terrible traffic on route 7, it took as long as 45 minutes to get to the park. Downtown Toronto--forget it. Traffic is terrible.  This hotel would be ideal for a business traveler but not for families. A king size bed probably fit well in the bedroom, but it was difficult to move around the two doubles in our room. Breakfast is CROWDED, I can't say that strongly enough. The very nice staff person was challenged to keep up, but she did her best. Eggs were frozen or from a mix, the meat everyday was some version of sausage, it's impossible to reach the toaster given the way the breakfast area is set up. Don't count on pastries, there were only some dried out scones. The oatmeal was terrible.  They do need more desk staff: while they are all very nice, many times there are too many guests waiting.

We especially liked the closet organizer and the many drawers available for organizing the contents of our suitcases. Breakfast was adequate and a cut above other similar places I've stayed. The following was available every single day: waffles, 2 hot entrees and condiments (like salsa, fresh tomatoes, etc.) 3 types of bread for toasting, bagels, yogourt, fresh fruit salad, fresh fruit (bananas, apples, oranges), fruit juices/tea/coffee. There were various other offerings that changed on a daily basis,like muffins, scones, or apple squares, etc.)  Three days mid-week they provided a complimentary light supper.  There were lots of other extra touches, like all-day coffee/tea,a complimentary popcorn pouch in the room, free wifi, free computer use, free printing. There was an outdoor area for sitting at tables or reading, which also offered barbecues for guest use.  It was close to stores and services, and very close to 404, 407, and Hwy. 7.

304938117,markham\ca\181720\181948\304938117.html,Staybridge Suites Toronto,"Stayed here while I was in Toronto with family to go to the Toronto Ex. While I didn't have any major issue with the room or my stay, it wasn't what I was expecting. The website doesn't quite accurately represent the rooms we received. It makes it seem larger than we received as well it mentioned king size beds in which I certainly didn't receive. The room wasn't small by any means but I was under the impression I was recovering a 1 bedroom suite. The one issue I did have was that my room's view was blocked by large air conditioners which were fenced in. I would suggest avoiding room 113 for that reason.  The kitchen was well equipped and stocked for me to make a stove top dinner. And free coffee and popcorn is a really nice touch. The dishwasher works well but it really noisy so I wouldn't run at night if you want to sleep.  The included breakfast was good. It's your standard hotel breakfast buffet fare. Eggs, breakfast meat, waffles, toast, etc. What is nice is the eggs and breakfast meat change day to day so there's a bit of variety. Overall I'm happy with my choice and would return have I a need for a well priced hotel in Toronto area. You will need a car to get around though or at least be willing to take a cab from the location.",4,positive

Since I am a vegetarian, I was specific about the suite have a proper kitchen. My previous stay at Toronto was bad. Hence i was very sceptic about this visit. My travel personal intimated that i was booked at Staybridge Suites, 355 South Park Road, Thornhill, ON L3T 7W2, Canada at $145.  Landed at the beautiful Toronto and I was not too sure what to expect....  But to my surprise, i got a corporate discount and the new price was $109!!!. Infact it was very close to my office. The hotel is located quite close to many major companies like IBM, CGI etc. The hotel is convinently located close to HW 407 and it is 10 minutes drive to Bayshore shopping mall. They even provide a free shuttle service withing 5 kms radius, which covers all the IT nearby IT companies and the malls.  Staybridge has good facilities including a full excellent kitchen with dish washer, free laundry, gym, swiming pool, complementary breakfast and evening snacks...!  The suites have nice interiors, fantastic room service and very friendly staff. The morning breakfast is a full continental one with lots of fruits, eggs, muffins, toasts, corn flakes, scrambelled eggs, fresh fruit juices etc..  Overall it was a wonderful experience. Infact in couple of weeks i was travelling to Ottawa for couple of months. I was praying that I get the same kind of hotel....",5,positive

The suite we got was absolutely fantastic. It had two rooms and a common room in between. Both bedrooms had their own bathrooms - completely separated from the kids! The rooms were updated and spacious - I definitely would recommend this hotel to families.   The pool was just ok. Wasn't anything spectacular. There was another family there bbqing on the patio which was a great idea! (full kitchen inside the suite).   So this is why our rating brought it down from excellent to average:  When we got there, our smoke detector was going off in random beeps - clearly the batteries needed to be changed. So we called down the front desk and housekeeping came up, not maintenance, and took the smoke detector away. For our entire stay! We didn't have a smoke detector at all for the three days, two nights.   Secondly, we had put up the ""do not disturb"" sign because in all honesty - we don't like housekeeping coming through, especially for such a short stay. Well that doesn't stop them. They STILL came in and cleaned our rooms! So we spent time going through checks to make sure we had all of our stuff. That was frustrating! It wasn't that the sign was taken away - it was still there when we returned from being out! SECURITY!!   So it's a shame that such a beautiful hotel, with a wonderful check in staff, great rooms, etc would get such a poor rating from me - but sorry - security and safety is priority!",3,negative

319170388,markham\ca\181720\181948\319170388.html,Staybridge Suites Toronto,"We booked a 2 bedrooms suite ( 1 room with a king bed and 1 room with a queen bed). We chose this hotel for tthe specific reason that we wanted 2 separate bedrooms but connected with a living room/kitchen. Since we have one teenager daughter, we did not want her to be sleeping in a separate unit that we will have to get out to the hallway every time we want to make sure that everything is OK. We also make sure to book the room a log time in advance on the hotel website, almost 3 months in advance and since it is their largest type of suite, we were charged their highest rate. We don't mind since this is the type of room we need and we even cancel our reservation at the nearby Homewood Suites since we wanted a king and a queen bed arrangements. We get to the hotel at 1:45. The front desk clerk said: I have some good and bad news. The good new is you can check in now, and the bad new is we can't not give you the 2 bedrooms suite but instead, we can give you 2 separate suites."" I am not a difficult person and usually, I really wouldn't mind. But in this case, I was not really happy since I booked with the hotel website directly and I booked the 2 bedrooms suite in order to have 2 bedrooms together, not 2 bedrooms NEXT to each other. And, the day before we check in, we even received an email from the hotel that says ""your reservation is confirmed"" ... Why confirm my reservation if there is no availability for the room we booked??? After a lenghty and ardeous discussion, they finally ""discover"" that there is a 2 bedrooms suite ( a queen and 2 double beds) which is available. Why wasn't this offered to me at the first place? Why try to make us settle for 2 separate units when there is obviously one unit very similar to the one I booked. Allison from the front desk was very courteous. She offered us a ower rate to compensate for the trouble cause by her co-worker.  On the positive side: Great rooms (when you get the one you book for) Great breakfast Fast wifi  Negative points: far from Toronto downtown but close to Markham.  Will we book here again? yes.

Our one night stay was both good and not so good. The largest issue for us was arriving in the dark with Hwy. 7 in the middle of major construction. Driving to the Staybridge felt like a rats journey thru a maze. The hotel itself was OK. Our basic suite was bright and we'll equipped but it also had an unattractive light odor half way between cigarette smoke and human sweat. This hotel has the oddest physical layout of any modern hotel that we've stayed at. It felt like a maze. The complimentary breakfast was well prepared and served in a bright airy area. Would we stay at the Staybridge again? Probably not. It is frankky too far away from the airport area where we usually need to stay.,3,negative

Normally I would not have a problem with this but it was 10:30pm. I went to the front desk and asked that it stop as I was going to sleep and it echoed throughtout. He thought they were just about done. At midnight it was still going so I called the front desk. No problem, they would stop it right away. Still going at 1AM! I called again and was informed that the person doing the work could only do it at at that time, so sorry.

You have a choice of one or two bedroom suites plus a nice kitchen which may help you reduce cost of restaurant dining. Another positive quality is the courteous reception and housekeeping staff. The hotel is located in a clean and quire residential area. Throughout my seven day stay I never was aware of any noise from inside the hotel or outside. But there are negatives. There is no restaurant in the hotel. The closest eating establishments are about a fifteen minute walk; not exactly easy under unfavorable weather conditions, and the restaurants there provide rather poor quality food. There is only one elevator to serve 120 units, and it is old and slow. The little carpet on the floor if the elevator is filthy. For some of the units, guests must go through a maze to reach the elevator!   Another negative is the hotel's policy on room service. The chamber maids do not vacuum clean the suites, nor do they mop the bathroom floor. Fresh towels are replaced daily, but not the sheets. The beds are skillfully made every day. I noticed a conspicuous lack of the customery  ""Do not disturb"" cards.   Free breakfast is provided, but it's rather basic and boring. However, the management is tolerant of people loading up with food and vegetables theybtakevtontheir rooms. I noticed some residents treating non- resident guests to breakfast.  Coffee and tea are available in the breakfast area (which also serves as a lounge) throughout the day. Would I stay at Staybridge again? Not very likely.

It happens, forgiveable.  ii) When I got into bed, I was overpowered by the smell of B.O. They hadn't changed the sheets after the last (smelly) guest left. They quickly did when I phoned down, but very gross.  iii) I bought a razor and shaving cream from the store in the lobby. I brought it back to my room to shave, but when I removed the blade guard I noticed there were already hairs and skin flakes stuck between the two blades.  *Somehow* someone had used the razor and it had ended up back on the shelf for resale again.  DISGUSTING and a serious HEALTH RISK.  I would never consider staying at this hotel again.  Other than that.... isolated. It is in the middle of a residential neighbourhood. No stores or restaurants within walking distance. Don't stay here unless you have a car.  There are better places in Markham for the money. And a LOT better places downtown for the same price.

The living room was large with a pull out sofa. The kitchen had a dishwasher, stove, and full-size refrigerator. The free breakfast was fine. The rooms were clean and the outdoor area was nice and had a fire pit. The only downfall is that the wifi in our suite was almost non existent (we were on the first floor).

The room setup was roomy and worked well, with one of the children sleeping on a large sofa bed in the living room. There were also 3 TVs, a large refrigerator, stove and small dining/work area.  Every night we enjoyed relaxing in the swimming pool. The breakfast options were ample. We did not attend the dinners other than to have some soft drinks, as we arrived from our Toronto adventures at the end of this period.  That said, as international travelers it was imperative for us to have access to the internet to plan some of our activities. There was no wifi reception at all from our room at any time during our stay (we were on the 3rd floor). Downstairs in the lobby area, there was very intermittent Wifi reception but it varied literally by the square foot and the time of day. Only on the final morning, as we were checking out, was the Wifi in the lobby area working consistently strong and reliably. Moreover, the business center had two computers but all too often the internet was not working (other times other guests were using them).  This location is not far from the GO commuter bus/train at Langstaff. If you are planning on travelling to downtown Toronto with your family, it is a good deal to use the GO system--for $20 US the 5 of us were able to commute round trip to Union Station downtown and avoid the horrendous traffic (there is ample parking at the commuter station, and it is free to boot!). This city reminds me more and more of Los Angeles in terms of the sprawl and traffic jams.

395128170,markham\ca\181720\181948\395128170.html,Staybridge Suites Toronto,"I stayed in the Staybridge Suites during the week (7/1 through 7/6) in Toronto with my wife and adult kids; we rented 2 suites.  1. The area that the property is located in is nice. Shops and stores nearby; Not too far from the toll-way; about 15 minutes from Wonderland; the area is a mix of residential and hotels and very easy to find. My one dissatisfaction with the location is that it is about 45 minutes from downtown Toronto. Driving back/forth to the downtown area became a task after a few trips.  2. The property itself seemed a little dated to my wife and I. The suites we rented (101 and 103). Each suite had a small stove, standard refrigerator, flat screen television, microwave, wifi (horrible), etc. The suites are designed to accommodate families, but there were small things related to the suites that made the stay simply average. In one of the suites we rented, the toilet handle constantly needed to be adjusted; the shower continually stopped up; and the wi-fi internet service was non existent. Maintenance came into our room to unstop the tub and it was discovered that there was a build up of hair (yuck) causing the stoppage. The refrigerator's freezer in my suite did not provide ice as it was supposed to. And as mentioned, the internet service did not work in our suite. One of my daughters needed the service for graduate school and she eventually had to utilize the business office at the hotel to get her task done. The hotel did not appear dirty but it could definitely use a tidying up.   3. A buffet breakfast is offered to guest of the hotel each morning. The breakfast is edible but less than desirable. Mostly powdered eggs, brown n serve sausages, waffles and fruit salad along with cold cereal. I opted for the fruit salad each morning.   4. The staff was pleasant overall and seemed willing to provide service to my family and I. Upon check-in there was confusion related to the exchange rate by the front desk as I was using American currency but the issue was eventually solved. I did have to remind the front desk twice about the stopped up shower and maintenance did eventually fix the shower.  Overall the stay was alright. This was my first time staying at a Staybridge property as we usually stay at Comfort Suites when we take family trips. Would I stay at the property again? I would definitely look at other options, but I would not discount Staybridge either.

The room was well appointed with coffee maker, hob, microwave and fridge....pots and pans etc you could require to self cater for your stay. Breakfast was included in the rate and was sufficient for anyone to start the day, the hot menu changed daily, and there were fresh fruit , toasts,bagels,waffles and more, and on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday evenings, they put a light dinner on for guests as well, we only went one evening, but again looked very well attended and this also was included in the rate, not forgetting there was a large car park that was also included in the rate..... So all in all, my opinion is we were overjoyed with our decision to stay here, and would recommend this homely, most friendly hotel to anyone for one night or like us 9 nights, so give it a try!!!!  Well done staybridge staff, and thank you for a lovely stay, regards from U.K

Originally planned to be in Toronto over a weekend but 2 weeks before found out about the G20 summit closures (thank you TA ) and made last minute changes. The result was a three night weekday stay. This hotel was the only one I could find in my price range at that point. We lucked out.  On arrival we were greeted by a friendly desk staff who made it clear they were there to help in any way possible.The room, 329, is a small suite that met our needs perfectly. There was a double bed and a sofa that opened into another double bed. The room had a full size refrigerator, dishwasher, range and microwave oven and equipped with basic silverware and pots, pans, plates etc. The TV set was the old fashioned CRT but there was also a DVD player with it. We barely watched TV and so cannot comment further. There was high speed internet available - wired- and connection speeds were very good.. The wireless is supposed to be in the lobby, lounge are only. However on the second and third day the signal came in strong in our room but not on the first day. I did not question it but the kids were delighted as they could use their iTouch devices to the fullest.  The room was clean, the bathrooms had clean towels (two sets only), there was plenty of hot water and bathroom fan worked well. The air-conditioning system worked very well although we keep our room at 72 degrees (Texas Kids and a wife who has her own furnace).There was no extra blanket in the room for the sofa bed.  Breakfast was included, consisted of eggs, sausage, home fries,different breads, yogurt, oatmeal and make your own waffles (Note to others: Please oil the heating surfaces of the waffle maker before adding the batter. Instructions are there but people do not bother read.) While the dining lounge was busy there were enough table to accommodate all on two days and on the third day they readily opened up an adjoining conference room to allow the bigger crowd to fit. Coffee and Tea were available all day.Choice of a Toronto paper and/or USA today was also available.   Parking was free and abundant. Incidentally the Hotel is in a residential zone adjacent to an office zone. Residents of the town-houses surrounding the hotel park on the quiet street in front of the hotel.  Several food places deliver (we ordered from Boston Pizza a 1/4 mile away) There are Chinese, Thai, grinder restaurants in shopping plazas nearby and a convenience store too.  The Kids loved the swimming pool. I, despite all the promises I had made to myself never used the gym.   In terms of hotel service  (a)Extra Towels and a blanket were provided immediately and with a smile. We had to go down to the reception ourselves to pick it up- that's what kids are for-but we did not mind.  (b)A second key stopped working mysteriously the second day but was re-keyed by a polite, apologetic staff (c)Housekeeping does only ""light-touch"" service which means they do the bed, replace soiled towels and empty the trash. No vacuuming, dusting, wiping etc. The heavier cleaning is done after one checks out, or on a designated day for those who stay more than seven nights.This is in keeping with this hotel being geared towards the longer stay customers. It posed no problem for us. (d)Soft drinks, bottled,microwaveable meals, popcorn etc all sold at a small ""store"" at reception area at a small premium (Charged $2.50 for the 2 bottles of 20 oz.Coke I got).

Notes- while it is fairly basic, the breakfast is complimentary and provides a start to the day. Pool is clean, functioning, and enjoyable. Location is ideal in terms of incredibly convenience to highways, restaurants, and stores. Staff is friendly. Rate is inexpensive. The room is not very nice, but it is clean enough. If you are just sleeping there, it will be fine. I would not want to spend any extended time in the room, or even in the hotel itself. It is a place to sleep, shower, and watch TV...that's about it. We spent most of our time while waiting for my husband to be released shopping or touring around Toronto anyways. Acceptable for the price but the room itself as well as the common areas (lobby/breakfast area) are absolutely nothing special. Recommend if that location was desired and budget was a factor; not recommended for someone who expects more than basic accommodations. Wireless internet worked fine as did the TV.",3,negative

The room was large, clean and well presented with coffee making facilities as well as fridge and microwave should you want to bring your own snacks in.  The bed was very comfortable and at first I thought a little light on bed linen - but this was only because I hadn't worked out the air conditioning/heated air system to warm the room.  A well appointed bathroom with clean towels and assortment of shampoos and conditioners was available with good power shower.  Best of all was the included breakfast with coffee, juices, toast, pre-boiled eggs to heat in a microwave, waffle griddle and mixture dispenser or English muffins to toast, all with condiments and butter to hand.  There was a simply charming lady overseeing the breakfast room and nothing was too much trouble to help an ignorant Englishman in the niceties of waffle making and always to hand with a cheery comment or conversation.

The person was very straightforward in getting the check in completed without being friendly. He did not ask if we wanted Internet access, a necessity these days when travelling. We seemed like he did not want to talk to us longer. And, every day, I had to access for a new Internet access code -- how annoying.  Getting to the room is very iffy. No elevators even though travellers carry luggage. The first-floor rooms have direct access to the parking lot, so don't be surprised that this is a true ""motel"". (Given the price we had, this room was overpriced.) For a few dollars more, I have stayed at much nicer places in the heart of downtowns of major cities.  The room we stayed in was non-smoking but there was a smoky odour to the room. The linens and bedding were clean. The furniture was new and the TV was flatscreen. The bathrooms, though, had outdated fixtures. A fridge was included in the room as was a coffee maker, but not of high quality. Each room has their own fan/AC unit, which can be noisy. Small window doesn't ventilate the room quickly enough.  There is an exercise room and pool in the first floor, but I didn't use that. Breakfast was served in a nice bright airy spot with make-your-own pancakes, fruit, cereal, toast, hardboiled eggs, and coffee. I ate breakfast from here everyday without issues.

I called in the front desk to tell them however they say no worry we are ensure that we dont have any bugs . so i was like ok,but my night there sleeping with my 2 kids and husband is terrible. The bed mattress was way too soft and i can feel the box spring under. Secondly, i found out on the blankets theres trace of burning. Is it normal? i dont think so. im pretty sure this blanket came from the smoking room. Im really disappointed with this hotel. I like the location however not the cleanliness of the room at all.

The price was steep ($126 + $15 for each animal) for a one night stay with one king size bed for three people, with complementary breakfast. Right off the bat, the lack of an elevator wasn't popular with any of us since we had oversized luggage. Once you've done hauling your luggage up to the room, how about hauling your breakfast up to your room the next morning! Yep, the next morning, we almost regretted the complementary breakfast as it was located on the left side of the reception, in an area no bigger than my living room (which was probably used in the past for a couple of sofas), with a puty kitchenette and just enough seats for no more than 30 people. Needless to say, there was no room to sit and we had to bring our breakfast up to our room. Such was the crammed state of the room througout the breakfast hours as we went back for coffee later on.

This was our third time staying at this property and we are always pleased with our stay. The rooms are clean and comfortable. However, during this stay we were placed in a room located to an entrance door. It was noisy when other guests entered the hotel and unfortunately we were woken up several times during the night. So, it might be a good idea to request a room away from the entrance doors. There are always a lot of parking spots available. The included breakfast was a nice touch. It has hot and cold items such as: waffles, eggs, english muffins and juice. In our experience it was always busy in the breakfast area and can at times be crowded when trying to prepare your food. We were unable to find a table to sit and eat so we had to bring our food back to our room to eat, which is not that big of an issue. I also want to note that we have always stayed on the weekend and maybe during the week it is not as busy. We enjoy staying at this hotel because it is across the road from lebarons (an outdoor store) and it is a short ride to the Vaughan mall . The hotel has a pool and hottub available for use and they are kept clean. There is also a gym which we did not use. When we went to use the pool we grabbed towels from our room. This was a good idea as there were no towels available at the pool. However, we did go down to the pool later at night so maybe earlier towels would have been available.

152234159,markham\ca\181720\182902\152234159.html,Comfort Inn Toronto Northeast,"Started off great, asked for a basic smoking room and the lady at the counter said $99/per night. Coming from a Ho/Jo down the street, mentioned they were offering $89 (but they didn't have smoking), ""If you could match them I'll take it""... ""Done"" she said. After heading out to take care of some business, I came back to check in. Since some time had passed, it was a different rep at the counter, but when he looked up the name he saw the amount stated and off to the room I went. Dropped the bags/stuff in the room, left to grab some take out and brought it back to the Inn. After eating and television, it was time to crash as it was late already. Here comes the part you want to take note of... Adjusted the heat to high, the room was cold (understandably, considering it is Toronto in Feb. and they're not going to leave the heat on when there's no occupant(s)). Sleepy time... around an hour in, I start to feel discomfort, a lot of restlessness. Soon after, I remember scratching and itching... In a half deep sleep... tossing and turning, thought it might be the heat. Got up to reduce the setting, continued back to my in and out sleep experience. Recall thinking ""I should go and get another room, something is wrong here."" But because I was in that slumber, figured it was not worth the hassle of grabbing the gear and arranging for a swap... all this in a semi-conscious state of mind, sort of like a dream. Finally, had woken up from one of the worst sleep experiences, to realize the bite on my wrist was from a bed bug (saw it earlier, but shook it off as not a big deal, possible pimple). Continued to have the itchy feeling, at the back of my neck and also the inner thigh. When finding the bite on the knee, figured I had enough to show them what was up (It is known for indications to be visible after 24 hours). Now the not so fun part... In a city where your guilty before proven innocent, where the truth is found further than pluto... bringing it to the attention of the staff. That I did, and out came Nick the manager. He headed to the room to inspect, and after a few minutes, a staff member had asked if I could go to the room on his request. When I entered, there was Nick, a maintenance guy, and what appeared to be a cleaning lady. With the mattress flipped up, he pointed out the bed bug cover (which I saw before leaving the room earlier), stating that it is not possible because of this. In fact, it's more proof that they were trying to contain the problem, where he was claiming it as preventative measures. You see, bed bugs nest in the seams (edges) of mattresses and can live without feeding on blood for up to a year. If contained in this cover, after a year they should die out. But they are not full proof, plus they also live in the wood works of the frame. They can only be stopped through regular chemical treatment... Which is costly for the service, and closes the room from revenues. Plan B, a $10 cover and cross your fingers. There was no beating the arrogance of Nick. I looked him in the eye and asked (already knowing the answer from the bed bug cover) ""Have you ever had a problem with bed bugs at this hotel."" he answered ""No, never."" As soon as he said that the maintenance guy flinched and turned his head, a subconscious body movement when he heard the lie.

I really appreciated the ""mini frig"" and ""mini microwave"" and in particular.., it is always very convenient to park my company vehicle just outside the 1stb floor patio doors, giving me free and easy access to bring items (luggage and the like) into my room. The bed was exceptionally comfortable with great pillows. There was great water pressure for the shower and bathroom sink and lots of hot water.

I have been working in the area for the last 6 months and I have been staying at their hotel. For me at least they are ideally located (right off of the 407 Hwy )for my line of work and during this time they have excellent service quality day in and day out.  The cleaning staff are great. They keep supplies well stocked and promptly replaced. Floors are clean despite the dirt I track in from working at construction sites (I do try to minimize this before I come in)  The morning staff are exceptionally friendly to the guests and keep the continental breakfast hot and well supplied with food. And again they keep the breakfast area nice and clean.   The maintenance staff promptly make repairs. In the past the exercise bike in the fitness room wasn’t working, I informed them of this and it was repaired and working the very next day.  I find the staff at the front desk are fantastic. They are friendly and are attentive to your needs. They even go out of their way to make freshly baked oat meal and chocolate chip cookies for the guests every night! They don’t have to do something like this but it’s the little touches that makes the stay that more pleasant. One night I left my ipod in the pool room and totally forgot about it. The next day the woman at the front (Peggy) asked me if I had lost my ipod and handed it back to me. I was oblivious to the fact that I had lost it but she was observant, seeing it with me before and was so honest to return it to me. A lesser person would have done no such thing but the staff at the Comfort Inn will do this day after day.  I find the quality excellent and would recommend their establishment to anyone.

However, when you are paying to stay at a hotel, you are primarily paying for a comfortable night's sleep, and unfortunately I spent four nights sleeping (or trying to sleep) on a mattress that made a coffee table seem comfortable by comparison.  In all other areas, the staff were friendly and courteous. The cleaning staff did a thorough and exceptional job every day, even going so far as to organize my toiletries neatly for me on the bathroom counter when I returned in the evening (this may be considered an invasion of privacy by some, but I found it touching). The desk staff were wonderful at check-in and check-out. After taking the hotel's customer survey, and having noted on it what I have said above, I received a personal phone call from the hotel management apologizing for the beds, and offering me a discount on my next stay.  The non-smoking and smoking areas of the hotel are in completely separated wings, and because of this no odors were present in the non-smoking areas.   Due to these contradictions, I cannot make a definitive recommendation on whether or not to stay here. Hotels in the Markham area are quite expensive, and I picked this one because it was on the lower end of the price scale (though I still paid around C$100 per night on weeknights). The service and cleanliness were fantastic. However, I would have preferred a good night's sleep for the price I paid.",3,negative

I stayed 3 nights, along with approx 20 other people.   Check-in was simple, given my key and told where my room is. I march on up to my room at the farthest point from the front desk (I'm OK with that) . Along the walk however the hallways were full of garbage bags, and beer cases. This was at 4:30pm, maid service was cleaning rooms and as they went down appeared to leave all the garbage bags from the rooms along the hallways. This is prime checkin time for a hotel (4:30pm) what on earth were they thinking?? So I get to my room, and my room card/key does not work. I ask the maids can they radio from desk to confirm that I just checked in, so that they can let me into my room, drop off my bags, then I will walk back to get a new key... they would not do this for me. So I march back down to the front desk with bags in hand. The girl at the front desk says ""let me guess, your key doesnt work"" I say no... then behind me, a guy says, mine didnt work either. I get TWO new keys this time, and make my way back up... they work.  My room was nice, aside from the smell that other reviewers described. The room was furnished well, and relatively clean, aside from a beer bottle at the foot of the bed.   The 2nd night I returned to the hotel, take the long walk to my room, and neither of my keys work, I make the trek back to front desk, tell them my keys dont work, and they blame me. She tells me not to keep the key in my pocket with me cell phone, dont leave it ontop of a laptop. So i challenge her on her assumptions, and inform her its not the first time I've used a hotel key thank you, it was not on a laptop, and I do not keep my cellphone in my poket, and let me remind you its not the first time I have had to come to you to get my keys fixed. She keys them, gives them back to me, I go back to my room, but pass two co-workers staying in different rooms walking down the stairs to the front desk to..... get new keys.  It is a problem this hotel must fix, but instead they attempted to lay the blame on me.  The breakfast was good, waffle maker, toast, engligh muffins, fresh fruit, cereals, hard boiled eggs. It was good.  My largest objection (aside from the trash and keys that dont work and front desk staff that dont care....) believe it or not was simply location. There is NOTHING around this hotel. NOTHING. On their website they list all the restaurants nearby, all the services..... there are none. There are restaurants that have gone out of business however. I walk out the front door, look left, look right in one direction I see highway, in another I see a road with rtraffic lights so I go in that direction. About 5 blocks away I find a place to eat dinner. Unless you are able to drive to eat, or willing to pay for a cab, do not stay here. this is not a good location to host business partners who arrive from out of town, and take a cab to the hotel.

On Hotwire you don't find out the hotel name until after you book; I was given the Comfort Inn. THEN I read the reviews and was pleasantly pleased. However, upon check-in I was told that ALL Hotwire bookings are smoking rooms. No warning I could see to this effect on the HW website. I pulled out my wallet and begged: 'anything, anything but a smoking room and while you are at it can I buy an upgrade to a king?' We were given a non-smoking, king sized room for - NO EXTRA CHARGE! Yes the hotel is a bit tired, but no worse than any other in this price category and it seems everyone knows it's a great stay for the money because it is usually crowded. Because of the nature of our visit breakfast had to be early, but it was still easy to see how, with the tiny and poorly laid-out breakfast room, 8-9 am could be sheer chaos. That said, at 6am you get a good, hearty, reasonably peaceful breakfast. BONUS - have dinner at the Chinese Buffet across the street - pricey but unlike any other Chinese buffet you've had in Toronto and well worth it. Our room was comfy, quiet, clean and everything worked - overall, you could do a lot worse. For the price and kind service, I'd stay again.

I arrived 30 minutes after check-in time. The outside of the building could use some fixing up as well as the bench in the front but, just small cosmetic things. The lobby was clean and cozy. Check-in went very quick and smoothly. Front desk Staff were very friendly. My room was very clean. King sized bed in the room was very comfortable. I liked the assortment of pillows (soft/firm). Very spacious room. I liked that there as a couch, as well as two chairs at the desk. The microwave and fridge were clean inside and out. Definitely great to have to store juice, fruit and heat up leftovers. Curtains and furniture (except, bed, tv, micro and fridge) a bit outdated but, in good condition. The Bathroom was very clean and lots of room to move around. The only issue I had, was with the toilet. Had issues with it flushing. Could not have two people use the bathroom one after the other. Had to wait a few minutes inbetween flushes. The cleaning ladies were very friendly and did a great job.  My partner and I took advantage of the free breakfast. I took a tip from another person who had stayed at this hotel who advised to get up early. We woke up at 6am and headed down in our comfy clothes. No one was down there the first morning until 6:45am-7am. We enjoyed making fresh waffles. We ate the sausages and scrambled eggs as well. There was also fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal, oatmeal, coffee, hot water, juice, muffins, bread, english muffins etc.   Tim Hortons, gas stations, Mandarin, Swiss Chalet and other food places not far from the hotel. Across the road was a Chinese restaurant. We never ate there but, we noticed that the parking lots was full every evening. Checkout was a breeze.

216650229,markham\ca\181720\182902\216650229.html,Comfort Inn Toronto Northeast,"Here is my breakdown for the Comfort Inn Markham.  I will admit that this hotel was so average that I almost didn't write on it but I need to get my reviews up so why not.   Service: When we came into the hotel we were treated reasonably well. We wanted an internet password and got it. They told us about breakfast and things. Pretty good. There was a copy of the Toronto Star at the door in the morning. I think that is always a great touch.   Cleanliness: The hotel was superclean. They obviously vacuumed a lot and dusted which was great.   Location: I don't really think it is close to much. It was close to my friends place so if you want to go there, go ahead. About a 20 minute drive to Subway station. 10 minutes drive to 401.   Value: I would say we got good value. Booked on booking.com at around $104 I believe.   Rooms: Not bad at all, very clean, great bed and the room is surprisingly very large and comfortable. Solid internet access and even a small fridge.   Breakfast: This was one of the worst continental breakfasts Ive seen. The room everyone was eating in was very small and there were only a few tables. Due to the congestion, the breakfast tables were messy and where you got the food was pretty disgusting. This could all be avoided if they found another room to have the breakfast. The food selection was pretty good but watered down eggs are not for me.   Overall it has good qualities and bad qualities. If you do select this hotel, I probably woudnt write a review because, well you will probably forget about the place.",3,negative

218794792,markham\ca\181720\182902\218794792.html,Comfort Inn Toronto Northeast,"We choose this hotel for its location - in the center between several attractions we wanted to do on the northern side of Toronto and that did not disappoint. There were several huge positives during our stay - the staff was friendly and helpful, the room was very clean and comfortable, the pool area was great with a hot tub, pool, and a wonderful steam sauna.   The problems all seemed to fall around the lobby area. Our biggest issue revolved around the free breakfast. The tiny eating area was so congested that it was difficult to get anything and sit and eat. The entire area needs a quick review and a few changes that would make everything flow better. For some reason they have the coffee and tea carafes stuffed way in the back corner and therefore everyone has to maneuver around to get to the back to just get a cup of coffee or a refill. If this was moved onto the table in front of the check in desk right where the breakfast area starts - it would eliminate 90% of the back-up. That would also help with our second major issue with the hotel - empty carafes at all hours. One of the things we love about staying at the choice hotels is that at nearly any hour - you can grab a cup of coffee or some hot water for tea or hot chocolate. We stayed here 3 nights and not once did we stop down and have any of the pots with anything left in them and it was obvious we were not alone as there were empty cups with just a splash of coffee left all over the counter. Because I am not bashful - we asked them every night to make us a fresh pot and waited or came back down to get our drink, but it was very frustrating that they obviously do not make that a priority or even an afterthought as at no time did we see the front desk staff busy. Usually they were just standing there waiting for someone to ask them for something.  That leads us to the other major issues I have - towels and the pool area. We have stayed at a bunch of hotels and almost all of them have towels in the pool area or extra towels in your room for swimming, but here you had to ask at the front desk and give the your room number to get the pool towels. It was also frustrating that we choose a room for 4 with a king bed and a pull out sleeper and our reservations had 4 yet we never got more than 2 towels in our room and we repeatedly had to ask for sheets and blankets for the pull out sleeper. I felt like I had to spend an hour each evening with the front desk staff getting additional towels, sheets, pool towels, or coffee. Once I could understand, but all three nights tells me it is a trend.  The location was also a bit weird as there is not a lot of restaurants or food service nearby. We struggled to find something other than a subway or a Burger King nearby, but by eating at whatever attraction we went to - it solved that problem after the first night.  The last thing that bothered me was the parking lot was very small and very tight and there were a lot of larger pick-up trucks and vans in the lot. I think with the construction going on - several of these guys were staying there and it made it difficult to park.  I struggle with this hotel because the necessities that we require - a clean comfortable room at a reasonable price, a pool with amenities, a central location close to attractions - were all spot on and it really was a comfortable place to stay with very friendly staff at all levels. The extras that we expect and have found at Choice hotels across the country - were all just lacking or just not quite right at it made the experience not quite what we had hoped for.
 
 
 Room Tip:  Be aware there is no elevator - so second floor rooms require you to carry your luggage up stairs.

The salt water pool was great for the kids. The location was nearby all the areas we wanted to visit. I liked that it was free parking and they have very good wi-fi (except for one night when the wi-fi and the cable reception when out) The hot breakfast was a hit with the kids and parent. I wish that they had a Keurig in the rooms rather than a 4 cup coffee maker (time for an update) We pre-paid our room so for the value on the discounted price, I think we got what we paid for. Both families made reservations together (cross referenced the confirmations with the hotel) and requested an adjoining room. We also required rooms with 2 double beds because we were traveling with young children. It wasn't until we got to the hotel that we were told only the rooms with 1 queen bed can be adjoining. At first they were going to put in rooms on opposite ends of the hotel until we made a fuss and placed us in rooms next door to each other. Expect clean accommodations, nothing fancy.",4,positive

The staff that we encountered were accommodating. There are a few things, though, that I should mention should you consider staying there. There are two floors to the hotel, but no elevator. I find this unacceptable since most guests travel with luggage. Guests who have pets must stay on the first floor(yes, this is a pet-friendly hotel) Unfortunately, we requested a pet-free room and ended up on the second floor. This would be a problem for seniors or disabled people. The front desk clerk offered to have someone carry our suitcases upstairs after we asked where the elevator was.. The breakfast room is very small and cramped. The breakfast was average and it was difficult finding a place to sit down. We happened to be there on a busy weekend at the end of June, so perhaps it would not be so congested at other times of the year.

The staff was very pleasant, the complimentary breakfast was sufficient & the rooms were comfortable. They even had a microwave & refrigerator! There are a few negative notes.....the breakfast area is way too small, smoking right outside the front door brings the smoke smell inside the hotel every time the door opens.

300529723,markham\ca\181720\182902\300529723.html,Comfort Inn Toronto Northeast,"First item to note, if you are mobility impaired, this 2 storey property does NOT have an elevator. The property is in a light industrial area beside a busy road (Woodbine). There is a Costco on the other side of Woodbine. There are various eateries along Woodbine and many more along Hwy7 just a couple of minutes north by car. Everything from fast food to Italian, Chinese, Japanese etc. A car is a must to get around the area. The hotel does not have a restaurant.  We made 2 stays separated by 6 days in between. During both check-ins, I found the front desk staff to be impersonal. They were not rude but were certainly not friendly. They seemed disinterested, it reminded me of toll both cashiers, stiff and no smiles. During our combined 5 day stay, I found the rest of the staff to be just the same.  On our first stay, the card lock of the entry door nearest our room was broken and when we returned 6 days later, it was still broken. Both times, at check-in, the front desk staff directed me to use this door. On my second visit, you'd think after 6 days they would know it's broken and not send guest there. So thinking they fixed it, I tried the door and when it wouldn't open, a staff member passing by on the inside, opened the door and proceeded to admonish me for trying to open the door.  The rooms were clean, the beds and the bedding were comfortable and clean. Plenty of pillows. Microwave and small fridge. Small work area. One room had a missing face plate on a wall outlet (speaks to maintenance) which would have been very dangerous if children had been staying in the room. Average size room. Windows can be opened. Surprisingly quiet; no water running sounds, hallway noises were not noticeable. Plenty of towels. Wi-Fi worked well for email and web browsing. Did not attempt to stream a video.  Free breakfast consisting of the usual breads, cereals, juice, milk, hot make-it-yourself waffles, scrambled egg-beaters, pork patties, yogourt, assorted fruits. The eating area was relatively clean considering how many people were passing through. However, it was a really tight fit because the room was so small. Often, people spilled out into the small lobby or many just carted food off to their rooms.  In general, the facilities were decent and reasonable for the price. The downer, you may have guessed, was the staff. Would I return on my next trip? Probably yes, if they keep their reasonable prices but if I find another property nearby in the same category, I will go there instead, even if they charge me up to 10% more.

The pool could use some comfortable lounge chairs and small tables instead of the current wooden Adirondack chairs...but it is large, with a hot tub, steam room and it appeared well maintained.  Unfortunately, this was the worst hotel breakfast I have had in a long time. The breakfast room was very small and so crowded you could not get in and out of your table with out inconveniencing other seated guests....assuming you could grab a spot to sit. The attendant was overwhelmed and trying to prepare the prepackaged food in a closet sized room. No one in our family risked trying the meat that was served with the terrible scrambled ""eggs"" because we couldn't tell what type of meat patty it was supposed to be. To be fair there is a waffle maker, cereal, yogurt, apples, etc. that are fine. I would probably stay here again if I was in the area.

This one has a 2-star rating on the Choice scales, and if it weren't for the concerning elements it would those 2 stars. Hotel includes an indoor salt pool, hot tub & fitness room, of which all seemed fairly nice but were not of main concern during my stay. The bathroom was of questionable standards, with dirt build-up and dead bugs in the light fixture, red stains on the bathroom floor, that major eye-sore of a patch job in the ceiling and of course matching mold stains and water leakage behind the toilet, because its not a bathroom unless you have leaking water right? Other features include smoking rooms (2nd floor), sliding doors for direct access as we needed a pet friendly room which came in really handy.   Breakfast was standard continental and overly cramped due to the general design of the breakfast area, service did as best they could working through the overcrowding of messy unorganized guests, but the free food was decent.  Was also unimpressed with the housekeeping after finding an old maxi pad wrapper under the bed, that wasn't too terrible no, but housekeeping also neglected to clean the couch from the previous guest in that room.  Have to rate this between poor and terrible. 1-star.

It was a short drive to the various Toronto sites we visited - CN Tower, Royal Ontario Museum, Casa Loma, etc. – but is not right in the city so you aren’t trapped in the crazy city traffic.

The room itself had a flat screen tv, microwave, mini-fridge, coffee maker, hairdryer, iron and ironing board with an ample supply of fresh linens.

I think this may possibly be the only smoking hotel in Markham so if you are going to call around like I did, don't waste your time. The Comfort Inn has smoking and non-smoking rooms.  Also included was a complimentary Continental Breakfast that had a great selection of foods (fresh fruit, muffins, buns, toast, bagels, yogurt, cereal... coffee, tea, juices and milk.) There was also a couple hot items and everything was fresh and well stocked by the sweetest lady.  The staff were extremely friendly, knowledgeable and seemed to take great pride in their work.

There are several entrances to the hotel where you have to use your room key to get in. The room keys easily deactivated and on four separate occasions during my stay I had to go to the front desk to get new room keys. At no point did any of the front desk staff members ask for identification to make sure that it was my room. They either asked me for my room number and reactivated the keys that I had or if I didn't have the keys with me they simply issued new keys based off of the room number that I told them.

There is a waffle maker there, so if you want one you'll have to wait in line and wait the 2min to make one yourself but hey it's fresh! We had a problem with the AC and maintenance showed up within 5 min of our call and he quickly determined that we needed a replacement unit. He brought one to our room and had the new one installed in 15 min. He was very fast and professional. The pool isn't super big and doesn't have a deep end (5ft at it's deepest) but it's very clean and presented well. There's a gas station right next to the hotel which is a plus, also a super market and restaurants 1 block away. If your going to the Toronto Zoo it'll take you about 30min in mourning traffic, about 40min to the CN tower. Some of the down's i can think of is it's very close to a small plane airport with planes coming and going all the time but if you keep your window closed you can barely hear them. They have 32"" LCD tv's in the rooms but they are on analog cable (bad quality) and you can't adjust the colour or picture size so your stuck with some channels too dark and with the wrong aspect ratio. They have wireless internet but make sure you get a password from the desk when you check in. I had to call the front desk 3 times before they gave me a password that worked. Overall it's a very nice hotel and the price is decent and i'd stay there again.",4,positive

So I repeated, ""Damages, what damages could I possibly cause? I am a Platinum member and when staying with my points no place ever asked for my credit card.""

Then I was surprised to find out that he was giving us a 2nd floor room with a senior in our party. Most places already have our room ready for us and even have a small token welcome bag for us when we arrive. This place was not ready for us at all.   The breakfast room is small and crowded. Then when I wanted to watch MSNBC, I found out that they do not have it. They did have CNN. With all the choice of hotels with better customer service, I see no reason for us to stay here again.

But it is clear that it takes far less in Canada to be a Choice gold winner than it takes in the US. First, when I went to the counter on a Sunday afternoon, the girl behind the desk didn't say, ""Hello, Mr. Smith. Thank you for being a Choice Privileges member and thank you for choosing to stay with us."" She just asked for my credit card and told me that if I wanted any towels for the pool, I'd have to get them from behind the desk and they would be charged to the room. This was a first for me at a Choice hotel. Next, there is no elevator and there was drywall chunks down the hallway, as they were going through a renovation. The room was perfectly clean, and the pool and hot tub were immaculate. The next day, I needed Canadian money for the washer/dryer and there was a different girl behind the front desk. I asked if she could change US money for Canadian, and she said, ""Won't your quarters fit in the machine?"" I said they might, but it took a dollar Canadian coin and I sure didn't have one. She finally swapped me and we could do laundry. When we checked out this morning, I just handed the key cards to the front desk clerk. Since points paid for our room, he just nodded and said, ""You're OK. No receipt."" There was nothing like, ""How did you like your room stay, Mr. Smith? Thank you for staying with us."" So a simple training of the front-desk staff is really needed here. The hotel itself is nice and clean, so it is clear that whomever directs the cleaning staff is doing a great job. But whomever trains and directs the front desk staff needs more work. Finally, the breakfast area is very cramped, with only three tables and about a dozen chairs available. But the food was as good as any other Choice hotel.",3,negative

There was a misunderstanding with the package price with their website regarding the Ontario Science Centre (OSC) packaging. It states one adult and one child OR 2 adults and 2 children package. I booked 2 rooms for 2 adults and 1 child per room and expected packages for such for the price that was listed for the package that I booked online through their site. There was only one price listed for book now and no mention of a more expensive package. Upon arrival I was told it was another $15 per ticket to get the second adult/child ticket per room. I tried to explain about the website pricing, but I wasn't going to get anywhere so I paid the difference and figured I would deal with it later instead of wasting time(we were just there to pick up tickets and pay so we could go to the OSC and were coming back after to stay the night). Anyways we enjoyed our stay and our visit to the OSC. From the room I sent an email requesting the difference back and to change their website to reflect the actual pricing. My email was forwarded to the hotel and I was contacted by the manager a few days later and the refund was provided ($30 plus tax -$15 for each of the 2 rooms we booked). At the time of this review I see the website hasn't been changed to address the problem. So know that there is excellent value in the package (even with the extra $15 fee for 2 adults and 2 kids package), but best to be aware so you don't start your stay with a unexpected up-charge. Overall I recommend the the OSC package with this hotel.

My first wasn't a great experience, but the second was much better so I thought I'd give it one more chance in the hope the first was an anomaly. It wasn't.  Let me start by saying the hotel is old and looking quite rundown in the interior corridors. It needs an update desperately. That could be overlooked, but the rest cannot.  I checked in late - about 10:30 pm - and stood in the lobby waiting for the desk clerk to get off the phone. I'm typically pretty patient, but after 15 mins and realizing he was giving a status update to his manager, I suggested he get off the phone and call him back while he dealt with the customer in front of him. Just really poor customer service.  The room felt dirty from the moment I walked in. There was something sticky on the carpet next to the bed that I found by stepping on it. When I went to move the clock on the bedside table, I had to wrench it off since someone had spilled something and it hadn't been cleaned up. The surfaces all felt tacky so maybe they tried to clean up a spill then used the same cloth to wipe all the other surfaces? No idea. The toilet wouldn't flush unless you held the lever down for an extended period which was demonstrated - with loud explanations - by the staff member who came to investigate. It was 11:30 by this point - I'm sure they neighbours appreciated the explanation, too.  Throughout my stay, the front desk staff just seemed disconnected and uninvolved; there was little to no response to queries or requests and checkout was delayed since he was, once again, on the phone.   On the plus side, the housekeeping staff were pleasant (if not particularly competent), and the ""breakfast lady"" was lovely even if there was never any room in the pathetically small breakfast area. Wifi connection was good, the desk chair actually worked, bed was comfortable, and the fridge and microwave are always appreciated.",2,negative

Most disturbing was the shady activity going on here in the evenings. Rooms on the first floor, with women coming and going, different gentleman joining them, expensive cars driving around the side and back, parking, and entering rooms from the outer sliding doors, staying for an hour or so then leaving, other men scanning around the outside of the building on their cell phones, likely on the ""lookout"". With this type of obvious activity, and staff members regularly ""patrolling"" the halls, it would be very difficult to believe that they are not aware of what is going on here.

We asked to change room the first night of our stay, but were denied due to lack of rooms available. Instead the hotel sent someone to talk to the drunks, things calmed down for a few minutes, and restarted not long after. We had a 6 months-old baby with us that kept waking up as much as his parents... We had to call repetadly and finally silence came, I guess they all went to bed. On the second night, same happened again, but we were finally moved to another room, since the person at the reception told me that it would be easier than to calm them down. Since they rented several rooms for around a month, I guess the hotel manager felt that it wouldn't be wise to offend the noisemakers...I guess it's understandable...business wise.

The lady in the breakfast room was very busy trying to keep supplies of food for everybody, again one complaint I noticed at 10:00 am when breakfast finished she took one towel and wiped down everything with it and this just spreads germs. The pool and hot tub were excellent and I would have given a higher rating but I am always amazed that hotels do not give a fair discount during renovations but that's just me. Also the exterior door at the end we stayed at did not always lock properly and could be opened from the outside without a key, this is a very serious safety issue and needs to be attended to with some urgency.

There was no businesses or stores anywhere near us just people's homes.. So I called the hotel and spoke to front desk clerk and asked him if he could call us a taxi and explained to him that the bus had dropped us off and we didn't really know how far we were from hotel.  He said here is the number to call a cab while standing on side of the road trying to make a call from our cell phone found out the number he gave us was for a limo company then while still standing on side of the road I then had to find the pen find paper and write a another number for the cab company and call them to send a taxi for us. I feel that this was totally unacceptable and had put us through more stress than necessary.  When we checked in we were not told where the pool was located nor that there was pool towels we had to use. People were outside drunk and yelling at being very loud at 3 am. The only good thing about the place was the pool. For the price I paid was not worth the money at all especially to be treated that way.

And there were cigarette burn marks on the furniture and the bed scarf, The telephone was not working ( the transmitter was not working, but it was repaired very quickly after talking to the front office.) There were not enough hand towels , but yes enough bath towels for showers. While the sink handle worked it also came off in your hand. I did see a sighn taped to a passage door window that repairs and decorating was in progress, I did not see and sign of work being done. Breakfast was as usual crowded with people and they di have another room for breakfast use, but the coffee was nice black hot water with little taste. I like it black.

While checking in we start to carry our bags in....the door man standing inside watching...we finally notice a cart in the corner after our second trip ( daughter dance competition so lots of cloths/ costumes) it windy and cold out side and when my son goes to grab the cart the doorman takes it and starts loading the bags we already brought inside telling my son it's for him to do! He actually waited in the warmth while we brought the bags in from the windy, cold, wet outside! Wow classy place.  We went down for a late supper and it was descent expensive but descent. We get back to our room about 11pm exhausted and turned out the lights to find that in the area where the pull out bed is had a glass block wall that led out to the hallway...and no way to block out the lights from the outside hall! It was like daytime in the room where my son had to sleep! Amazing! A frosted glass wall that went directly to a hall! No curtains. I travel alot on business and pleasure, this year alone i've stayed in a minimum of 30 different hotels in eastern Canada and the US and have never seen anything like this ridiculous setup! Basically a frosted window that goes directly to the hall....with no curtains! We ended up getting 2 blankets to but over the glass from the inside so he (son) could at least try to get some sleep. If this was not for my daughters dance competition and the entire team was not staying here i would have already been at the nearest Marriot! The maintenance guy who brought the blankets was sorry...not his fault...and he said he would try to fix something from the hall side later tonight and would have the missing curtains put back up in the morning.  One last item...the main bedroom with 2 double beds....to close those curtains you have to actually climb over the one bed as there is no room between the corner of the bed and them wall to get by...another nice feature.",2,negative

The hotel lobby is grand - with a pub/lounge right as you enter - playing the Playoffs! It is bright and open. Reception was not far fetched for Ontario standards (we are from the West) - they get the job done but you aren't going to feel like that special person you would, say if you entered a hotel in Vancouver or Vegas!  Our room was on the 6th floor and our room was a great size. You step into the Living Room and go past the bathroom into your bedroom where that King Sized bed awaits. The bed was super comfy and clean (my priority) and the decor was modern and sleek. Bathroom was gorgeous and well maintained and they had Peter Thomas Roth toiletries!  We had a great sleep, as it was quiet and for the price of the hotel - you really cannot go wrong. I paid $169.. and well $75 for the dog.

Arriving at the hotel it was not clear where the lobby was located. We initially stopped after making the right into the parking lot and then had to get back into the car and drive around to find the lobby.  After entering the lobby the two ladies working at the counter were on the phone. It was about 3 minutes before we were even acknowledged. The young lady that checked us in was a little on the cold side. She could have been a little more welcoming for a hotel that has had numerous awards.   Our Stay ------------- The hotel's cleaning staff was incredible - they were very friendly and offered great help. The bar area for this hotel closes at mid-night so if you are looking for something to relax and do after mid-night - good luck - there is nothing to do around this area.  We were there for a wedding and the night after one of the events we were having a good time and security visited our room and asked us to be quiet. We tried and they had to come back again. At that point we took the party to another room (there were over 50 guests staying in this hotel as a part of the wedding). The security guards followed us up there. By this point you are probably thinking - no big deal - they should have don that right? Well get this, no one had complained about us being loud - the hotel staff simply did not want anyone to complain and then they would have to credit them for the night's stay at the hotel. However, after we went to the other room, the guest in that room happened to be a Hilton Diamond member - lets just say they did not do anything to us after that - she was given free reign over anything she wanted to do - they did not bother to say anything. So if you are a regular traveler and there is someone with a Diamond level - guess how is getting the better treatment.   The Room ----------------- The room was clean and very welcoming. The only issue I had with the room was the bed was some what uncomfortable. The shower was interesting because it is half a shower glass. No real issues with the room.   Other ------- The hotel charges for parking and charges for WIFI. In today's world I find it un-necessary for a hotel to charge for these two services. We happened to luck out and got our parking fee waived as a result of the wedding - however, we had to visit the front desk twice to get the charges taken off our bill.

We decided to stay in East Toronto so that we could be closer to the Sarborough campus. Little did I know that The Hilton/Markham Suites was 10 km from the 401. So be sure that you know exactly where this hotel is located - that was my mistake not the hotels.  Once we arrived it was a shock to see that his was a very large and very modern hotel. With a stylish and gorgeous restaurant and bar. It was very nice indeed.   The hotel room was a suite style with a king size bed and a pullout sofa. The room had two desks, two TVs, a sitting area and a very nice bathroom. I have to say the pull out sofa was awful. I mean really uncomfortable and I had to call housekeeping to open it up.   We loved the space of the room and it is well worth the stay. I would have to let you know that this is a hotel that cater more towards business guests. This is where the extra costs come in. There is a $14.95/day charge for wifi and $8 + tax for parking. If I were in downtown Toronto, I can see why you pay for parking but if you are in the suburbs, with a large parking lot, parking should be included in the cost.   It was never mentioned on check-in that there would be a charge for parking. There is no where else to park so you have not choice but to pay.   The hotel is attached to a spa/fitness facility. the pool was small and VERY WARM. I'm not sure how you can do a lot of laps for exercise when the water had to be around 90 degrees. Not pleasant.  The facility has exercise classes and a full racquet ball and squash courts. There is a $4.00 facility fee in the hotel bill so make sure to take advantage of the facility. It was wonderful with multiple showers, sauna, complimentary shampoo, bodywash, lotion, hairdryers and towels.  This is a great facility for business meetings so keep that into consideration.

It was spacious and included a living area with couches and a separate bedroom with a walk in closet. Internet for 24 hours was $9.95.  My only complaint was for the actual meeting for our business group. We requested internet and the on site tech said we didn't order it. Then we were given an access code for only 1 user vs multiple people. The meeting room was also missing 2 tables. Overall it didn't seem to be too organized and there was no one from the hotel that came by to check on how our meeting was going so I could give this feedback directly.",3,negative
208504778,markham\ca\181720\182903\208504778.html,Hilton Toronto / Markham Suites Conference Centre &amp; Spa,Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights for a conference this past weekend.  I stayed in a room with 2 double beds. Very spacious and clean room. My room had a bath tub however my friend down the hall complained becasue she only had a shower stall. The bed and pillows were comfy. Mini fridge and microwave included so that was nice.  My only real complaints about the room were that there was no make up mirror and no full length mirror. I think that stuff is pretty standard so no idea why they dont have that.  Staff was friendly. The meeting rooms were great and I must say the catering was TOP NOTCH! Really enjoyed the food at the meetings. I wouldn't mind staying at this hotel again.,3,negative

It was the second year in a row that our conference was held at this hotel and it was an extremely enjoyable experience. There is a lot of parking available close to the main entrance. I know normally it would cost $10 but, for us, it was included in the cost of the conference. Much appreciated. It is located just a block north of Hwy 407 so very accessible. Check-in was very fast and efficient. Important to note, however, that the only rooms that come with a large soaker tub are the rooms with the double beds. I had originally requested a king size bed but when I heard it comes only with a shower, I asked to be switched to two double beds so I could take advantage of the tub! Room is, actually, a suite. Couch with desk and tv as you enter the room, then two closets, a mini bar fridge, coffee maker, bathroom with soaker tub, and bedroom with nice view. Food was in abundance - all included in the conference price. Staff were helpful and polite. Each morning, a ""National Post"" newspaper was at my door. Check-out was express with the statement under my door the last morning. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. Unfortunately, didn't have time to experience the spa. Maybe next time when visiting for pleasure not business!

Very nice room though overall, but the rooms I stay in on vacation have been quit a bit larger than this especially for a suit. I would have liked a bit more space and a balcony for the simple fact of convenience having to go all the way down and through the lobby to go outside, especially to enjoy the evening air while trying to unwind at the end of the day was a bit annoying. The staff were great and helpful and location for travel to restaurants, bars , and attractions was easy to get to. I would recommend this hotel to others and would stay again.",4,positive

In town for a wedding taking place in Markham, used HHonors points to book the stay since we didn't think we'd feel like driving to a hotel downtown after the reception and other wedding activities. We were very pleased with the room (king NS suite). Room was clean, beds were comfortable, housekeeper was thorough. Only complaints to the room was that space was a bit crowded with excessive furniture. I understand for someone on an extended stay, these extras might be necessary but, for us, it was just ""stuff."" Nice shower, no tub. The biggest (and most common here) complaint is that there's no in-room free wi-fi. Who doesn't have free wi-fi these days? At least they had it in the lobby BUT they shut off your free access to it the morning of your check out. The restaurant was average. Apparently, they offer ""high tea"" buffet on Sat and Sun afternoons from 3-5pm. Sunday Brunch also available, I think that was $35 (maybe 39). Lobby bar was nice and cozy. Staff and service was very friendly. Plenty of parking (not free). Across the street from a few small restaurants, pubs, coffee shops, and grocery store.

I waited for a good 20 mins to finally talk to someone at the front desk due to both agents being on the phone for a very long time. I was then told at check in that my room type (corner suite) was not available. I was ok with a downgrade but was told there would not be a discount of rate. After getting settled in, I headed down for dinner at the Essense of Unionville. I was greeted by a friendly hostess who seated me promptly, to my surprised at a restaurant in a hotel of this quality I was ignored and passed by numerous time before being served. After dinner I headed back to my room, only to find the T.V not working. Maintenance came up shortly after and fixed the situation. Within 30 min Maintenance was needed again for the toilet. I felt sorry for troubling the staff so many time but the maintenance was very helpful and was humorous as we chit chatted during his work. The next morning I did not get my wake-up call and was late for an important meeting. I came back during the evening to tell the front desk about this missed wake up call. They said sorry. I am not out for revenge but small mistakes made by staff of a hotel should be addressed to prevent future occurrence. This hotel will always only be a last opinion for me from now on.

The bedroom has floor to ceiling windows and is quite bright, but the living area has no outside light, so feels a bit dark. In an effort to fix this, the living ares has a large expanse of glass blocks on the hallway wall. This feels somewhat like a fishbowl, but the hotel provides curtains to close off the glass areas. Rooms are overall very good - lots of connections for electronic devices, coffee maker, etc. The bathroom was recently renovated, with the bathtub replaced with a bathtub-sized shower.

Summary:  Front desk staff was very good. They were helpful and assisted with switching my reservation closer to an airport hotel on my last night before an early flight even though this was well after normal checkout time at no extra charge. The serving staff in the restaurant was nice the one time I went for breakfast to sit/stay. However, a couple times I went to use my room included continental breakfast coupon and though you'd get a coffee and Danish to go it seemed that was it was met with less than enthusiastic approach unless you were sitting and staying.   I stayed in the extended stay rooms and the rooms were large and seemed to be newly remodeled. Beds were comfy and room itself had all the needs of a kitchen, living room area and office area.   Here are some things noticed over the longer stay which was nothing super huge, but for a higher end hotel I wouldn't expect to see them per say. The first night I went to get a soda out of the machine in the hall. It was sold out. As I left to check out a couple weeks later the machine was still sold out-never filled in that long. A room service tray sat in the hall for multiple days without being picked up. The rate I had included parking, but if you didn't get that rate-paying $10 a night to park and it's not like the place is downtown or in a cramped area for parking. $10 to pay to park in a surface lot seems a bit crazy. I could even see it if maybe someone wanted the covered parking they had but the open air surface lot for hotel guests!? Free wired Internet but $9.99 for wireless Internet again is a bit steep. Now the wired internet did not work in my room or in another coworkers room so they gave us the wifi included which is nice, but the fact we had to have it charged and then ask later to have removed from the bill is some additional work.

The downside is the pricing structure: reasonable room rates, however, everything else is extra: facility fees (whatever that means?), $10 for parking, $10 / per day and per device for WiFi (unless you are a VERY frequent Hilton guest), watching anything but a handful of basic channels on TV. Relatively low room rates may attract the unsuspecting first-time traveller, but many of those will think twice before returning.

The bedroom adds another flat screen TV, bay window, and nicely soft queen-sized bed. Bathroom lacks a tub but the shower is generous. The biggest complaint was light leakage from the glass-block window into the living room at night - the curtains couldn't completely block it out so people sleeping in the living room had to contend with it.   Hotel guests have access to Club Markham, a full service private health club off of the lobby, featuring squash courts, an indoor swimming pool with hot tub, aerobics studio with kickboxing classes, and 3 fully equipped workout rooms with an outstanding selection machines and free weights.

Non guests should have been removed at some point. Security please! We were there for the event as well, myself and 3 children,but hotel guests should have been high priority. The restaurant was a bit $$$ to go with children, and so were the drinks at the LobbyBar. Because the seating area is part of the lobby/bar lounge, the children weren't supposed to sit there. Hmmmm... where shall I put the kids? Back to the room children. Nothing else really for them to do! Although they have plenty of space, the lounge/bar is situated smack in the middle of the lobby. So much for quiet time and or privacy. Location Location Location! Maybe if there weren't kids everywhere...I mean literally on top of you, this may have been acceptable. The room was nice, spacious and clean. Needs better block out shades to keep the hallway lights out of the living room area of the suite. Had flat screens in both Living room area, as well as bedroom. The outdoor Zen garden was tranquil and lovely.Ahhhh peace at last. As with most large hotels, the hair/nail spa was over priced.

Breakfast at the Essence restaurant was surprisingly pleasant. Good selection and quality. Baked goods were excellent - the danishes are a must-try. Bad luck - there were a few families down the hall. Their gang of kids were running and screaming down the hallways from 9 to 11.

Another disappointment was they did not offer free breakfast. Again, literally every other hotel we've stayed in, in both America and Europe, have offered free continental breakfasts, even holiday inn express offers this! The hotel offered breakfast, but you had to pay about 30 dollars a person for it, instead of spending a fortune on breakfast, we walked across the street to McDonald's.

There was a VERY LARGE group of wedding guests staying at this hotel, many in suites. The pre-wedding party was also held there. A block of rooms had been reserved by the bride and groom.  1. Check-in time 3 o'clock, we arrived at 4:10, there were only 2 people on the front desk, there were 10 people ahead of us. Took 45 minutes......all these guests had reservations which were confirmed by credit card - no need of this long wait. 1 (one) bellman on duty!!!! This was on a Saturday.....wedding was Sunday.   2. We had requested an up-grade in May when we made the reservations, which was to be confirmed at check-in time. When I asked about it she said ""if you didn't get an email there won't be an upgrade.....I showed my email stating I would be informed at check-in, not by email......she checked, and yes there was a room available to upgrade us to, she wasn't very pleasant.   3. At the price of this room we said we wouldn't pay for parking so they just took our license number.....we also did not pay for breakfast (we were given a voucher, I believe this was part of the wedding package) there is not much around this hotel, so people who would not be using this hotel (for any reason) would not have a reason to park here............and the parking lot was huge, more than enough room for all the guests if the hotel was fully booked.  4. While the bride and her attendants were getting ready the maid of honour called to request 5 champagne glasses (not the champagne, just the glasses) they wanted to charge them $5. each for using the glasses. They finally said if she came to get them herself they wouldn't charge! Seriously!  5. One of the guests was very ill. All of us had gone to a morning ceremony. She called the front desk and requested if someone could bring her some power drinks and crackers. They did not have power drinks in the hotel. She said she would pay if someone could get them for her.......the hotel charged her $65.00!!! There was a convenience store very near-by.  6. Wi-Fi was difficult to understand how to use to get connected. (as I assumed it would be free) There is a one day rate and a 3 day rate, no 2 day rate. When I called they said it was $9.95 per day. I said that was ridiculous and they said to go ahead and request the Wi-Fi and it would be removed from my bill......nope.....I had to have my bill re-done at check-out. You can go to Tim Horton's and not even buy anything and use the Wi-Fi.......Free, Best Western - Free. I have stayed in low-end motels and at the Bellagio in Las Vegas - I have never been asked to pay for internet. This fee should be dropped. It is 2014 after all.   7. This is a beautiful hotel, very clean, pool area clean. Zen garden needs some weeding and flowers, but a relaxing place to sit. This hotel is in Markham, not downtown Toronto, where you ""might"" have to pay more for things (although I think it is uncalled for to pay for parking and internet)  8. I witnessed some parents in the restaurant wanting to take some things to the rooms for their children so they wouldn't all come to the restaurant.........NOT permitted, have to order room-service, which I am sure would cost an arm and a leg.   We stayed in this hotel because of it's proximity to the wedding venue. If you are wanting to travel into Toronto, stay somewhere else, traffic is very busy into the city.

My husband and I checked in on Thursday, August 21. There was only one person on duty helping with the check ins and we were shocked to find out that we had to pay for Wifi! A Hilton that charges for Wifi! Seriously? Coffee shops give it away...and you don't even have to buy anything. Many guest arrived the following day and staff was limited to help with the check-ins. The line went from the counter to the front doors. It was quite sad to see that extra staff had not been added to help out. The next day I went to complain about the Wifi situation and was told it was part of our package but we have to order it, than have it deducted from the bill at the end of our stay.  One of the guests that was part of the wedding party got ill with the gastro...she called room service (yes it was around 3:00am)and asked for PowerAde with crackers as she was severly dehydrated and needed to try and put something in her stomach. She was told the hotel didn't have crackers. She then said that she would pay anything for these items...low and behold, a baggie with a dozen crackers and 3 PowerAdes were delivered to her room......at a cost of $68.00. Seriously?  My daugther had also rented a huge suite for the her and the bridesmaids to be used the night before the wedding. This was also going the be the suite for the wedding night. The bridesmaids had a bottle of champagne...when they call down for champagne flutes, they were told it would be $9.00 for the flutes. Again, seriously? The final straw was when the bride and groom returned from the reception at 2:30 in the morning, they were confronted by management advising them that they had been undercharged for the suite and could they settle it up.....really? They were in their bridal clothes and management wanted the bill settled????!!!!! Finally management relented and allowed our daughter with her husband to go to their suite. When they got to the suite, the room hadn't even been made up! WOW!  This hotel is lovely, location is great, Zen garden off the pool is so pretty.

Some sessions were in the basement level where there was only one elevator for access in addition to the stairs. When sessions were over, the elevator was slow and packed. It must have been very difficult for those with mobility issues. The main elevators were also packed at times so we took the stairs.  That said, the food and beverage was good.

The pool was very small and completely over chlorinated (there was also a fitness class going on and swimmers were NOT allowed to go in) but the rest of the spa area was lovely. They even have fitness classes like yoga that guests can participate in. It is fairly close to a subway station to train it into Toronto and it is at a mall, so plenty of parking available.

In this day and age, the TV would skip channels and the sleep timer didn't work. The bed was comfortable enough. And then there was the bathroom. I didn't have a shower stall or bathtub. The shower was right beside the toilet. It was the most messed up thing I've ever seen in North America. I hated it.  One night there was a fire alarm that seemed to go on forever. No apologies or explanations were offered even though it occurred at night and kept me from being able to sleep.   The continental breakfast is pretty good though and unlike most of the hotels in Markham, there is a selection of restaurants in the general vicinity of the hotel.   Also, if you need a cab in the morning be prepared to wait. And avoid the limo mafia that seems to be camped out there.

The living room with a TV was at the front and the bedroom with a separate door to the back with a TV in there as well. The Bathroom was in the middle. It's a great set up if someone wants to go to bed earlier than the other. Being as I was sharing the room with a coworker, this was ideal.   The Conference Centre was very well laid out as well. Food that was provided at the Conference was very good. The waiters do however need to be reminded how to serve. Many times I saw them reach across people to set dishes in front of people, and or remove them without warning or asking. It was a large group, and yes it takes longer, but I felt it was very rude.  The only other small detail the hotel needs to fix is the paper washroom ""Men"" & ""Ladies"" signs, held up with tape. They sell actual signs at Staples. Not a huge investment for a four star hotel.   We also ate at the Japanese restaurant on the premises. The service was very good and food was good and great presentation.

The biggest issue for me and my colleagues was the complete lack of adequate lighting in the bedroom I don't need runway lighting but it would be nice to have enough lighting to read easily in bed and to be able to dress in the morning and put make-up on. It is totally unacceptable that the bedroom was virtually dark at all times. In the rooms we had, there are two mirrors separated by an in-wall television - only one of the mirrors has any lighting - but 3-4 small pinlights do no provide sufficient lighting to even unpack much less get dressed and put make-up on. There are two beds in the room with two night tables but only one light to be share between the two beds. Again completely unacceptable. If the hotel wants to create a feeling of dimness in the bedroom, layers of lighting would provide adequate lighting for those of us who want and need it and dim lighting for those who don't. Additional problems - I will readily admit that I dislike hotels where I can't open the window and breathe actual air but I have accepted the fact that this may not always be possible - however I have stayed in hotels where air system keeps the room fresh and airy - this was not the case in this hotel. The room was stuffy and dry even with the fan turned on permanently. I will not be recommending this hotel to friends or professional colleagues. On the plus side, the Japanese restaurant in the hotel was very good.",2,negative
243230953,markham\ca\181720\182903\243230953.html,Hilton Toronto / Markham Suites Conference Centre &amp; Spa,"For such a big name hotel, with such a substantial price tag, I really think many things fall short.  1) Upon check-in, was told the phone in the room was not working or being fixed. And then asked do we want a different room? Really a no-brainer there. The room with the broken phone should not have been offered in the first place.  2) How can you justify charging your guests for parking and for every night? I have stayed at hotels all over the world and this was a first for me.  3) We book a room for 2 adults. The hotel offers a complementary non alcoholic beverage and the appetizer of the day. Great! Only to find out the is only One beverage, and it is limited to a very small roster of options. Again, Hilton should be ashamed of such practices. Better to not offer anything at all and your guests won't have to get irate for a second drink voucher.  4) The hotel boasts a state of the art gym and workout facilities. Free to use of course. But, you better have your own lock, or you will have to rent one, or lug your stuff back up to your room and then come back down for your workout.  5) When I read the perks of the hotel, I really wondered why it specified, complementary ""wired"" Internet. Later to find out that wireless Internet was only free on the ground floor and common areas.  6) I know many hotels offer quick checkout, where guests can leave their room keys in the room and just walk out of the hotel with the printed receipt that is slid under the door. But seeing as we had 3 room keys and to avoid any issues with missing keys and excess charges, I like to return my room keys in person. When I got to the front desk, both female clerks were on the telephone. I showed my room keys, one clerk acknowledged me and took the keys from me with a smile. Again, not what I would expect from a hotel with the price tag and name of Hilton. Politely asking the person on the phone to hold for a moment, while you deal with a guest that just stayed at the hotel would have been a much more respectful and customer service oriented thing to do.  There should be no need for your hotel to nickel and dime its guests, who are paying a premium for the brand. You really must do better by your guests.  On a positive note the room design, furnishings and upkeep were exactly what I expected for my stay, so I thank you for that. Would I stay there again, no... Very unlikely.",3,negative

We were enjoying our stay until we began hearing the loud construction noise while we were trying to sleep. Seriously, using a jack-hammer in the middle of the night, we were in shock. This made it very difficult to get any sleep. We had been advised, upon check-in, that renovations would be occuring that night, to the gym. However, the hotel staff assured us that construction had also occured the previous weekend, and guests had not reported any disturbance. This was not the case on the night of December 12th! The hotel staff also told us to call the front desk if we found this was an issue.   We did call the front desk, three times! After the first call, we were told that management would be notified and something was going to be done. The noise continued. After the second call, we were getting extremely frustrated, since it was impossible to get any sleep. We were tired, and needed to be up early for our daughter's volleyball tournament. After the third call to the front desk, we were hoping that something was going to be done. Instead, we were told that we needed to wait another half-hour. We were extremely upset about the lack of concern. Many guests travelling with our group were also complaining.   When we checked out on December 13th, we thought that management would speak to us about the problems we had experienced. Instead, all we heard from the front desk staff was how they were sorry about our experience. This definitely did not help us feel any better about our hotel experience. We were expecting some kind of compensation for this terrible experience!

Cons: - $10 parking fee per night. - The restaurants seem overpriced. - The swimming pool is crowded, largely due to selling fitness membership to local people.

I was disappointed to know that hotel has a electricity problem and pool and Jacuzzi are not working. Steam room in women side did not work as well. I used sauna, it was nice. I went to sleep early. At 11:30 at night it was a noise of drill that waked me up. I called guest services and they confirmed that the reparations are going on (11:30 at night). They stopped shortly. Next night I was waked up at 12:30 at night by… drill noise (!). I called to guest services and they said that they would stop it right away. They did. As a result I slept 3 hours both nights. When I talked about that with the reception they said that they planned reparation at a first night, so it was OK for me do not sleep. However, second night it was a mistake, so they will cover the night fees. I found the logic to be SO STRONG that I just had to write about it.

It was renovated last year and now looks quite modern with today's aesthetic standards. Also, I love how grand the main lobby is, something which is quite common in even semi-modest hotels in Asia but sadly often lacking in many nice hotels in North America. And the rooms are all suite-sized rooms, so paying this much money for a pretty gigantic room is actually excellent value.  Now for the BAD part...my wife and I got married in April 2014 and reserved a room here for our wedding night getaway. We didn't hold the wedding reception here itself but that's neither here nor there. I booked through the reservation phone line which is the property's own (not Booking.com or Expedia or any 3rd party phone line). I even reconfirmed the booking (who even does that anymore?) a few days before the wedding day to make sure everything is good. I was assured that it was, there was a note put on my reservation that this was going to be our wedding night.  Come the day itself, we found out that the hotel was overbooked and that they had arranged for us to be transferred to stay at the more unimpressive Delta Hotel, around 2 blocks away. WHO DOES THIS on someone's wedding night? We are usually very amiable (and tbh we are rather pushovers in the grand scheme of life) but on this day we were so angry. My wife was yelling in her bridal gown when we wanted to check in before leaving for the night's reception. The front desk repeatedly told us that there was a huge conference + tons of walk ins and that the rooms were overbooked. I said I didn't care as I made the reservation two months or so ago before the actual wedding date. Funnily enough, after making a very pointed complaint and bordering on making a scene, a room just ""magically"" became available.  What did we get as compensation from this? An apology card and what essentially amounted to a fruit basket. Apparently after causing us this much grief, we couldn't even get the room comped to us because we chose not to accept their offer of being relocated. So at the end of the day, we got a room only after we yelled for 15 minutes in the front lobby in our full wedding outfit, and we didn't even get a proper compensation out of it. I can't remember now but at best I think we were offered a pittance of a discount, which I don't even think we could use because we prepaid the room. And I'm not even sure anymore if that occured.  Great property, but I repeat: what kind of hotel KICKS OFF a couple on their wedding day who have booked the room two months in advance, simply because they filled the room with walk-ins which caused overbooking?",2,negative

Bad issue resolution. Bad plumbing. VERY SLOW INTERNET.  Location: Shopping center across the street with a bank, McDonalds, pizza joint, Greek salad place, Chinese restaurant and drugstore. All else = long drive.  The hotel exterior is modern, lobby is very nice with a bar and glass elevators servicing 10 floors. The rooms are showing some age and are not well soundproofed. Climate control is digital but iffy (we were moved because of noise and not enough heat). Parking is an extra $10 per day even though the parking lot is far from full (we were there for nearly a week and it was basically a ghost town the whole time). The room we moved to had a minibar. When I opened it, an already-open can of tonic water spilled out onto the floor. The bathroom did not have a heat lamp and had a strong, cold breeze blowing through it at all times regardless of what the thermostat in the room was set to. On our last day, there was no water. Not just no hot water, no water at all. We had to rush to the airport and it would have been useful to take a shower first. When I called down, I was told ""we have another building, if you'd like to shower there."" Seriously? When I checked out, I was comped two days of parking. Really, not being able to take a shower was only worth a $20 comp? Ridiculous. Also it's worth noting that this hotel is an hour from Toronto, a half hour from North York, and a half hour from the airport, if the 407 toll road is used. Longer if surface streets are used. It seems to be in the middle of a very Asian area in Markham. Not good or bad, just fact. Also, the Internet connection was free but DOG SLOW. Unusable for VoIP or teleconferencing of any kind (Adobe Connect, etc.)

Obviously it has a spa as well but I never ventured over there during my stay.  Now to the rooms- the beds are very comfortable. My only issue with the bedroom was that it seemed like the tv remote was either running low on batteries or the remote was just crap (I would believe either). I feel that could be something that could be easily checked when cleaning the room.   My only real complaint would be within the bathroom. Upon attempting to shave I realized the bathroom lights were not nearly bright enough to actually see what you were doing. It is more mood lighting than bathroom lighting. In addition, the shower controls are right under the shower head (common location). However, since there is no sliding door you had to step into the shower, turn on the water (it's obviously never warm right off the bat), and deal with cold water while it warms up. If the shower controls could be moved to the opposite wall that would make it much easier. Obviously that might be an expensive fix but just inserting sliding glass doors to them would also solve the issue. That fix would also eliminate water damage on the bathroom door due to water constantly soaking the door while the shower is running.  Conclusion- great hotel with minor updates needed.

The breakfast is decent.. but may be the only weak spot this hotel has.

But this hote deserves the praise. This is an all-suites hotel. So you get a living room (where you can lounge, watch TV, or, in my case, work comfortably for long periods at a time using my laptop and a really excellent Internet connection. Then, when it is time to call it a night, head to the bedroom where you can just lay down in a comfortable bed and have a good night sleep, closing the door and having a nice buffer zone from any noise from the hallway. It's this suite approach that helps feel like there is a sense of privacy and also helps you feel like you're at home when you're not. The rooms are clean, the linen is fresh, the amenities are perfect. The TVs (there are two, one in the bedroom and one in the living room of the suite) provide excellent programming. It is also possible to connect your laptop easily thanks to connectors in the wall, helping business travellers review material on their laptop or prepare for a presentation.

A couple only has one wedding night, and because of your hotel ours was ruined. We stayed at the hilton for two nights.The first was the night before the wedding and the second being our wedding night. When I booked this room (directly through your website) I made a request that someone get back to me about preparing the suite for a romantic atmosphere. No one responded to my request. I should have known this was a sign of things to come. Although the room was up to standard upon arrival the day when housekeeping arrived we were in the middle of getting ready and with so many people there it wouldn't be possible to properly clean the room. I asked the maid to make the bed and tidy the bathroom for the meanwhile and to come back later to really put the room back in order. She said she understood. Although when I was able to check on her work she had only made the bed (half heartedly) and she hadn't touched the bathroom. I called down to the front desk to ask them to send up someone from housekeeping after noon to properly clean the room. Again, we were told this wouldn't be a problem. Upon returning to the hotel on our wedding night we find the room in a total mess. No one had come to clean the room. It was a disaster. My new husband was livid. When I was able to calm him down and get him to take a shower, the shower head broke off spraying the room in water. I spent my wedding night calming down my husband, fixing a broken shower and cleaning my own room. That this happened at a Hilton hotel is beyond me. You would expect a higher standard of service at a motel 6. We were given a breakfast voucher from the night manager. A breakfast voucher!! We should have at least been offered an upgraded room for the night. When I went to the front desk to speak with the manager she was busy and I was told she would call before check out. That, of course did not happen. Had I not gone to guest services to complain, no one else would have addressed our problem. Even then, we were offered a 20% discount. Never have I been more disappointed in a company than I was with the Hilton. I had to push and reveal the details of my wedding night to get any kind of appropriate response from their staff. There is nothing you can do to give us back our wedding night, but I am still waiting on a sufficient apology and an appropriate offer of remediation considering the gravity of the situation.",1,negative

The only complaint...an extra charge for 1 breakfast of C$5.65....because I was told toast was not part of the continental breakfast I was entitled to ...rather it was part of the HOT breakfast. I found the charge a bit stupid as the price difference between the continental and hot breakfast was actually C$2 by a member of staff..but so as not to make a fuss I just paid it...  Taxi services were always on tap which was another great bonus..be aware there is a little shop which I discovered on my last morning and they have everything you need there at the same prices and some cheaper than if you were to walk over to the shopping plaza across the road - the lady behind the counter on the day was lovely and so helpful   YES....I would definitely stay here again!!!

The bathroom was outdate with a hard water encrusted shower head. Parking was just over $8 a night and the lot was not even secured. When we booked the place it looked like we would be in main tower but we weren't. We were put in their short tower next to it which did not feel very secure because it had its own entrance with no staff manned there. One night there was some strange people loitering in the parking lot and in the hallways. The hotel's internet was the worst internet I have ever used (my internet in 1995 was faster). Finally, the air conditioner sounded like it would start having mechanical issues and we were worried it would quit.

My husband prefers building 1, less floors, off the main building and higher traffic, and renovated last. There are squash courts, a gym, a pool and a fitness centre open to the public that you can enjoy as a hotel guest.

Regarding cleanliness I give it a 7. For the very first time in my 47 years of travel, I was harassed by the chambermaid in regards to getting the room cleaned. Finally I told her just to forget it, and requested a few extra towels. That was strange. We really only had breakfast at the property and every morning it was busy and every morning at 10 mins to 10 ( they advertise bfast until 10) the staff started putting things away. It felt very rushed and unprofessional. Having said all that it was a nice property. We were there for the 2015 Pan Am games and the city itself (Toronto ) was fabulous.

We could not have ask for anything greater. We stayed in a 2-double beds-one bedroom kitchen suite. It included a full kitchen, nice appliances (stocked with kitchen ware and dishes), den and dining room. There was a nice desk area and comfortable chair in the bedroom with glass paneled double doors that opened to the den. The bedroom and the den contained large flat-panel television sets. The unit had floor to ceiling natural light. The bathroom is spacious, however, the door that leads to the bedroom is glass and you can fully see full body images through the glass. The toilet fronts the door so there is limited privacy when using the restroom. The reason that I did not give a perfect score for this unit is because the hallway from the elevator leading to the unit is old, dingy looking and should be replaced. As well as the lack of privacy in the bathroom area.

Wifi was useless, so we had to pay for the upgrade, and I thought parking might be included seeing that there is ample parking available on site and we are in the suburbs after all, however there was another $10 charge. The spa has changed hands recently and is good. Main lobby/atrium was very bright and airy making it the perfect spot to unwind at the bar. Hallways had well worn and somewhat smelly carpeting in dire need of replacement. Double room we were in was very narrow dark and like a cave with light at the end of it (windows). Sitting area at entrance to room was too dark and dreary to enjoy. Beds were sagging although sheets crisp and clean. Bathroom had some mildew and messy caulking to replace obvious wear and tear, but deep soaker tub was nice. I was somewhat shocked when cleaning lady just let herself in to deliver face cloths that we didn't need. Overall, being the most expensive and highly rated hotel in Markham, I expected much more, without having to pay for it.

Since then, I was approached by the property who graciously offered to make it up to us. Final result was: A nice and mostly peaceful 1st year anniversary stay.  Nothing much has changed, facilities-wise. The newly renovated rooms (with two TVs!) were still nice and spacious, the beds were comfortable and the modern walk-in shower bathrooms were really nice as always. Hilton has always had nice toiletries/amenities (we're very detail-oriented when it comes to trying out/using hotel body lotions) and the Peter Thomas Roth brands carried by Hilton were very good, again as usual.  The staff were very pleasant and this time there were no hiccups to the overall stay. We also opted to get the breakfast buffet which was, in my opinion, one of the best you can hope for in Canada (I set hotel breakfast buffets in Asia as my barometer, which is admittedly a very high standard) with a large selection of hot and cold dishes.  Slight drawback was that the hotel, again as always, was super full. Teenage and children sports teams from around the province/country often use this hotel for a base, which is understandable given the large rooms. The rooms themselves were peaceful but the lobby and breakfast area are usually very crowded. If you don't mind this, then you will enjoy everything else about it.  I appreciate it when hotels care about what their customers think, and while nothing can be done to undo the wedding night fiasco, a peaceful and smooth 1st anniversary event goes quite a long way towards leaving a much more positive impression.",4,positive

I heard excellent things but was left disappointed.   We had a reservation for 6 and was led past their spacious (and 90% empty) dining area to the table squeezed next to the waiter's station. I asked the waiter if it was alright if we could be reseated elsewhere, perhaps in the main dining area, or by the windows, and he said ""but this is where we reserved your table."" Well, are all of your other tables reserved? We made a reservation so that we WOULDN'T be squeezed behind a waiter's station, but you will enforce that we sit here? After struggling to communicate with him, the young waiter waved his hand in a nonchalant ""whatever"" gesture and we squeezed out of the waiter's station area. I had expected him to lead us to another table, but he didn't. We stood around awkwardly until the hostess came over and understood our request and promptly seated us in the main dining area. Over the 2 hours that we were there, less than 10% of the tables were occupied. I assume that they just didn't want to ""open up"" their entire dining area, which is ridiculous considering how they market their afternoon tea menu.  The food was mediocre. If you like sweet things, the desserts will be satisfactory, but the selection was small for a ""buffet."" There were no properly labelled placards for every dessert so you have to go into it with an open mind and don't get upset when there are unexpected raisins in your cake. I was surprised with that some savoury selections were available but they were all mini sandwiches. The smoked salmon sandwiches kept running out, with little replacement. Overall food quality and selection is less than what I expected from a Hilton, and the experience was subpar at best.

A very nice lady from security came out and introduced herself to us. She came back to the room with me and could hear the noise before she got to our door. We decided to move to another room. Apparently we were next door to a lot of people in town for a wedding and were having after parties in the room. Other than the rude loud people next door, our stay was decent.

This hotel is new and functional (eg strong air conditioning, lots of counter space to place things) but for me, charmless. It is done in a 60s or 70s modern style, with a bathroom floor that is very slippery when wet (shower only, no bathtub). Our suite (a king suite with a foldout sofa bed in the living room) was long and narrow with a tall window in the bedroom, overlooking busy roads and parking lots. There is a window out of the sitting room into the hall, of those thick wavy glass/plastic bricks that are only translucent, though you can draw the curtains. If you are attending a function or a conference and will be using the place to shower and sleep, it's fine. The quarters were also quite tight for a suite. I would not recommend it if you are planning to use the room during the day (though the two-room design does make it good for naps).  That said, the place was clean, there were plenty of outlets by the beds and desks, the bed and linens were good, the towels plush and there were no issues with the newish room that showed very little wear. It is a true suite with a door that shuts between the sitting room and the bedroom, there are lots of mirrors, and enough counterspace in the adequate (though small) bathroom as well as nice toiletries. There is a large tv in each room with about 30 channels. The pool is located in a health club that Hilton guests have access to and is health club sized. It is 1.2 metres everywhere with no slope or stairs and the deck is quite slippery. It is pleasantly warm, and the room is a bit overheated once the sun shines in greenhouse-like. The whirlpool is large and very hot. There is a pleasant seating area outside of the pool with a fountain and seating. I would bring water wings and other flotation devices as there are none provided.  Edo, also located in the hotel, is a good restaurant - I have enjoyed their other locations - though it was closed when we stayed.‎ Though the hotel was only moderately busy, they did not want to give us the late checkout that my husband's Hilton status entitles him to.  The breakfast buffet was decent, with the hot breakfast buffet a $5 upgrade charge from the continental breakfast vouchers we received (scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, pancakes, greasy hash browns). You could do well off the continental breakfast with fruit, yogurt, bagels and cheese. The waiters were pleasant and efficient, bringing coffee right away, and it was in an airy high-ceiling room with plenty of seating.

The people who check me in are always super friendly and if I ask they are usually able to upgrade me to one of their 1-bedroom suites with kitchen. (I'm Gold, so maybe why I'm able to get the upgrade, but doesn't hurt to ask anyways). The suites are great for me as a business travel as they have separate bedroom, large bathroom with marble floors, a full kitchen with stove/oven, a 4-person dining table, a full sofa bed, and a office in a den. I like the fact that I can cook for myself when I'm away for extended periods of time and there is a grocery store just across the street.   Rather than standard hotel gym, this hotel gives you access to Club Markham which is a full service gym and health club with pool, squash courts, tons of cardio equipment, and great weight room. Much better than most Hilton properties.  I stayed here about 2 years before and it was before they updated the lobby and it was a flashback to 1970! It was very dated. I'm happy to report that they've completely updated it with a swanky new lobby bar which is happening in the evening with business travelers.   They've also added a executive lounge on the ground floor which is great. I find the service there is really good and they have a good selection of food in the evening.   Considering this hotel exceeds my expectations are most fronts, it was shocking how bad the breakfast buffet is. Not all of it was bad, the host at the front is the woman with glasses who is the friendliest person I've met. She always has the biggest smile on her face and is super excited to seat me each and every time I show up.   Some of the other wait staff on the other hand feels like they've lost all meaning in life. After I was asked for coffee, I rarely see them come by again. The buffet is usually good selection, but there's no egg/omelette station, nor do they include custom egg orders with the buffet. From past experience at Hilton, they usually have an omelette station or allow you to order eggs from the kitchen as part of the buffet.   One of the sous chefs walks around the buffet with his chef jacket unbuttoned with a white shirt under and his gut hanging out. It looks like he is wearing a house coat. I think it is very unprofessional and someone needs to tell him to button up the jacket or stay out of customer sight.  So other than the lackluster breakfast, the rest of the stay is excellent. I've stayed here a half dozen times and will continue to come back as long as I'm working in the area.

When we got to the room late that night after being out most of the day, we discovered that our room was right above a very loud wedding venue. The music was booming and shaking our room. I called down to the front desk to ask why we had been given this room and when the noise would stop and were told it would end after 1:30 am. No apology or explanation was given. So there I was, lying in bed and seething until approximately 1:30 am in the morning. (I could even hear the wedding guests chanting: ""One more song! One more song!"") We complained to the front desk staff the next morning and our parking charge was waived. I don't think that was fair compensation. In addition, we should have been told there would be a wedding that night and that our room would be right above the venue. I never understood why hotels with tons of parking in the middle of nowhere would charge parking. But after this experience at the Markham Suites, I realize the parking fee is probably just charged because the hotel can then refund it when people make a complaint and need to be appeased.

The sofa bed was very uncomfortable. We would only book at this hotel if we were 2 occupants as it was very uncomfortable for our daughter using the sofa bed.,3,negative

However, we were traveling as a family the night before last. We had just come from a hotel in Montreal with which we were very pleased. At the Markham Suites Conference Center we felt much less welcome. While polite, the front desk staff were not friendly or personable; rather, we had the feeling that we were imposing when interacting with them. The staff member who provided room service was gruff, rushed, and aloof, seeming irritated that he had to wait a moment while we made space for the tray. And, when we asked where we could obtain a luggage cart the next morning (since none were visible) we were told that we could not use one without using a bellhop. Maybe this is customary in some hotels, but not in my experience. I would have hoped that accommodating our (relatively modest) wishes as guests would have been a higher priority. The dining room greeter was an exception--she was friendly and welcoming.",3,negative

The hotel lobby, glass elevators and rooms are very nice and the staff is friendly. We visited the pool twice- it resides in Club Markham, which is attached to lobby. It's a warm pool with a hot tub but because it's shared with club members, half of the pool is roped off for lane swimming, and the pool is not open during Aquafit classes. Be sure to check the hours before trekking down, as we had to come back an hour later because of a class using the pool.   We ordered room service- delivery was fast and the food delicious.   The room was spacious but the chair and sofa bed in the sitting area are hard as rocks. The sofa bed is terribly uncomfortable- I can't imagine an adult sleeping on this. Having stayed in lots of suite hotels, this is definitely an area where this hotel needs to improve.   Complimentary Internet of Hilton HHonors members was adequate for web searching but wouldn't support Netflix.   The hotel was quiet and the parking ample. We really enjoyed our stay!",4,positive

The hotel has great easy access to areas north of Toronto particular the Chinese parts of Markham and nearby towns.   Overall the room was OK but it appears that the maintenance is not all it could be. Just small details seem not to be taken care of - some paint here, delaminating doors there, ok but not great bed comfort, etc. The stay was fine, there was a minor mistake with the billing which was really no problem. This hotel is in the suburbs with very little nearby. Despite this, we were charged for parking. I thought this an unnecessary fee. I believe it was C$15 per night so factor that into the price of the room.   The breakfast was nothing special at all but the service in the restaurant and bar was good.  I am unsure we will stay there again. The value was reasonable but I fear the condition of the property may diminish the next time we go.

We have small kids with us and had the worst welcome by a Hilton Hotel, which we are a member of its loyalty club. At the reception of the pool, we received only two towels and none for our 3 kids. No breakfast vouchers for kids, and the restaurant manager was quite rude and mean to tell me repeatedly that I could not take out if I bring a little cereal box for my children when we decided to take out instead of paying almost $40 in total for kids' continental breakfast. She was accusing me so loudly and treated me like a criminal of stealing their cereals. I just wanted to redeem the breakfast voucher and wanted to have the choice of takeout. Another problem of this hotel is that the bathroom which is located in the middle of the suite is a way too small. If you are not skinny, you would have a hard time just moving around in it. You don't even see the bathtub till you close the door as it is hidden behind. Although it is supposed to be a suite, you start thinking that it should be a one big open space rather than squeeze everything in. Anyway, we really wish that they could focus on not only adult couples but families with kids as well. We all will remember the experience we would avoid staying at those unfriendly hotels when we stay as a couple in the future.",1,negative

Good closets and storage, clean, staff friendly (doorman, reception and housekeeping were all really nice to our child). Wifi was very poor, and I was surprised to have to pay for parking. It's not downtown, and when we used to stay at the Delta just down the street, we did not have to pay there. Pool was under maintenance when we were there.

The staff have always been very friendly and accommodating. Everything is clean and I always feel welcome. They offer coffee, tea, juice, and water for beverages in the common area by the private rooms, as well cookies by the reception.  If you book a service at their spa, you'll have access to the steam room, their gym, and other offerings for the day. For couples' massages, you receive a free fruit platter after your treatment.  Eforea has a really easy-to-use online booking system where you can pick the service you want, type of staff (male/female/any), and see available times. I've never had a problem with scheduling conflicts or random cancellations through booking online.  A couple of things on my ""wishlist"" for this spa are heated beds and free wifi for those waiting to be served. If these, along with other perks added, I'll definitely give them a full five-star rating.  For those driving, park at the back of Hilton and don't pay. Eforea offers free parking for those who are visiting the spa.

We used our points to book a king corner suite, which was very nice. There was a panoramic view through the windows. We could not hear outside noise, and we were on the top level. Luckily, the bedroom was in the corner, as there was a lot of noise from the outside hallway. So we had a quiet sleep. It wasn't the best bed that we've slept in, but not the worst either. The bathroom was a little small in comparison to the size of the suite, but clean. There was a separate sitting area with sofa, as well as a separate dining area with table and chairs. There were two tvs - one in the bedroom and one in the sitting area - which were the smallest tvs I've ever seen. As we were walking down the hall to our room from the elevator, we could see several open doors with tvs and other equipment in them, so it seemed that they may have been in the process of changing them. There were no dvd players in the rooms, and you could rent them for $25 I think, through the gift shop. We have been to other hotels where they either had them in the rooms or you could use them from the hotel. We ended up renting a movie, which was even smaller than the size of the screen for around $13.  There are a lot of stores and restaurants in the area.

The housekeeping staff always did a great job at cleaning the rooms and the rooms did not have the appearance of being 'worn out', which is always a good thing.

I mean throw in a plate with the room, it's not that expensive. That said, if you're looking for a spa or fitness center, this location is superior, so it depends on your priorities.

Room service for towels and TV issues was addressed immediately and to satisfaction.

Overall the stay was enjoyable, but did experience a few concerns with the majority being quickly addressed: - Being a Hilton rewards member, we had the option to preselect our room. Upon check in, we were advised that the selected room was not available due to a 'maintenance issue'. We were provided with an alternate room, however; when arriving to that room, the dishwasher was out of order resulting in us having to move rooms again. - The room was varm and we were not able to adjust the heat. We were required to keep the room door open in order to get the cooler hallway air into the room. When checking with maintenace, the only option provided was to turn off the thermostat. This made for an uncomfortable sleep. - As we were staying two nights, we had left for the day to attend the basketball games. Upon arriving back to the hotel (at 4:00) we discovered the room had not been cleaned. When calling the Front Desk to inquire what time the rooms are usually cleaned by, they could not provide a time. This resulted in us having to request toiletries and clean towels as they had not been replaced. - The hotel offers a complete athletic club for the use of their guests. The weekend hours are limited as the club does not open until 7:30 AM. We went to use the club at 7:00 AM as the door was unlocked. While on the treadmill, the staff member spoke to us in a tone where we were being 'scolded' for being in the club before it opened. - Lastly, we were ordering a bottle of wine from the room service wine list, and when placing the order were told that the wine we selected had been discontinued and they tried to upsell a more expensive bottle of wine. We were told that our menu wasn't the more up to date menu, but we felt that we should get the price listed in the menu we had . They did honour our request. When the bottle was delivered, they mysteriously found the bottle that we originally requested, and also told that more were available to order.",5,positive
367451470,markham\ca\181720\182903\367451470.html,Hilton Toronto / Markham Suites Conference Centre &amp; Spa,"My family of four (2 kids 11 and 8) stayed at the Hilton Toronto/Markham Suites for 4 nights. We had the 2 double beds with kitchen suite. We didn't use the kitchen much but it was nice to have the fridge for water and fruits. The set up was perfect for us. There was a separate living room where the kids can hang out and I like that there was a dining area. It felt like we were home and we had lots of space to spread out. My only complaint is that it would have been more efficient if we had 2 bathrooms but that's usually not the normal set up for these types of rooms.   The double beds were comfortable but it would have been better if we had 2 queen beds as the kids move around a lot in their sleep. The bathrooms are all marble and modern. One thing to note is that the tower we were in where the kitchen suites are don't coincide with the floor numbers. So we were in room 1412 (in the newer tower) which would be floor 4 in that tower. To get to our tower from the main lobby, you can take the elevator to the 3rd floor, cross the connected indoor bridge and you end up on floor 5 in the newer tower. Then we had to take the elevator in our tower down a floor to the 4th floor to get to 1412. It might sound confusing but once you go through it you will remember. Also, they do charge for parking $10 CAD a night.  The pool is actually in the main tower and part of the Unionville Athletic Club. The locker rooms are getting dated and the pool area a little dated but the pool water was so warm (like bathtub water temperature). That really made up for the mildewly stains I noticed in the women's locker room showers. There is a sauna and steam room inside the women's and men's locker rooms as well. The hot tub was burning hot so be careful. I usually shower in pretty hot water but the hot tub water temperature was even hot for me.  Overall, we felt very much at home during our stay.

Not about the staff at check-in or the nice and cheerful ladies in the bar - you were all great! But your vouchers hit a wrong note!  When we checked in we were made very welcome: each of us was given a huge stack of vouchers. Complimentary access to the executive lounge, vouchers for the bar and for breakfast.... You name and we had it. Only to discover that our breakfast vouchers didn't cover a full breakfast: ""You need to pay five dollars extra for that."" After showing our impressive wad of vouchers we found that only 1 (one) cappuccino was for free.   At the executive lounge we discovered - just before 6.00 pm - there was nothing to eat. And finally in the bar - having ordered cocktails - we discovered the vouchers only covered 'non-alcoholic beverages'. Don't you think that's a bit cheap? When we asked the (Cuban) duty manager he didn't seem eager to answer our questions. He could have easily defused the situation by taking care of one round of drinks, but instead he disappeared.   If you want to make your guests feel really welcome (and we don't expect freebies for everything) get away from this measured hospitality. Do you really expect your guests to enjoy a free root beer or orange juice in the bar? And if you are not allowed to hand out alcoholic beverages by Canadian law, why not find other ways of compensating your visitors.   We liked this Hilton, most of your staff and your rooms. But on our next visit to Toronto we'll give it a miss. We like real hospitality, not your measured version. We'd prefer no vouchers or vouchers that actually show your real appreciation for our custom.

However, there were a few things that were laughably irritating: Upon first glance the room appeared to be very classy but upon further inspection we noticed things such as the fan in the bathroom being just 'for show' as there was no switch to access it. When showering, be prepared to completely mop up the bathroom and dry the toilet off after due to their ''genius'' door-less/wall-less shower design. If you want an up close and personal experience with whomever you're travelling with then look no further as the sliding bathroom door never stayed closed, didn't have a way to lock and left a 1 and a half inch gap between the wall and the door piece (which made for some comedic experiences and strategic use of music to say the least). During our check-in the very nice front desk lady informed us that for our convenience the Hilton has placed (1) Micro-wave in the common area for the people in attendance of the convention that was being held. That convention consisted of 1500 people for 1 microwave. Its the thought that counts I guess as I am not sure what it would be like during a non convention stay. If you're planning on being the person on the pull-out couch like I was intending on being, make sure that you pack ear-plugs as the architecture of the building makes for amazing acoustics which allowed the sound to travel all the way from the main eating and lounging area, down the open hallways and into the rooms.

My wife booked this property as one of our children had a swim meet at the Pan Am pool (which was only about a 10 minute drive). She got a rate of 149.00 a night which I thought was great given what I pay downtown. There is a nice waterfall in the lobby and a popular lobby bar.  Hotel staff were above average, we did get a couple of the ""eye brow lifts"" because we were a family and not business travelers, but overall smooth sailing. Our room was fairly well kept, we were in 734. The room looked great until you looked up, there was a lot of peeling paint issues, especially in the bathroom. There was a fridge, and TV's were new and had movies for the kids (pay extra option).   Food was great in the Essence Of Unionville restaurant, but the service was a 4/10 at best. We had the breakfast buffet the first morning we were there, we sat our selves and then waited about 20 mins for coffee. Had to ask for our bill about an hour later. Anyway no biggy, there were lots of restaurants in the area so we just ate out after that. Price was about average, 11.00 for buffet kids and 20.00 for adults.  Pool area and garden out back was a nice surprise. It does seem like it is run as a semi - private club, so there are ""regular"" members swimming laps that don't particularly like kids.   Biggest complaint is the parking. DO NOT PAY AT THE OUTDOOR PAY AND DISPLAY STATION IF YOU ARE STAYING AT THE HOTEL. We drove up and saw the unit for pay and display so we automatically thought the parking cost we were quoted was processed that way. Turns out they add it to you room and pay and display is for visitors. I also ended up getting charged twice on my credit card so we ended up paying 75.00 for parking over two days. A sign(s) should be posted directly on the pay and display unit indicating that hotel guests should not pay for parking. This is a blatant cash grab on behalf of the hotel IMO.  Anyway - overall 8 out of 10 because of the reasonable rates. Don't try and double dip on the parking and crack out some paint and I would rate more towards 9/10.

Major disappointment came from the service we received from the first desk and maintenance.  As it turns out our two bedroom suite consisted of two rooms brought together.

When I checked the info online again, our 2 rooms do include complimentary breakfast, and access to the lounge. So, we went downstairs and asked again the next day. I had to proof to another receptionist on my personal computer that both rooms are billed with full price, and showed her that our packages include them. We booked one room for 2 people, and one room for 3 people, and she said that she could only issue us 2 breakfast voucher per room, even though we booked for 5 people on the itinerary. This staff of this hotel needs to be re-trained to better service their customers. I don't understand why the staff can't be more flexible and just give us a 5th breakfast voucher, even though they messed up at our check in. Another problem is with the shower. The pressure is not high enough, so water came out very poorly. We contacted front desk, and someone changed the shower head, and told us that if this doesn't fix the problem, and we would have to live with it. This is very bad customer service. Lastly, the most ridiculous part of this experience is when we checked out, the receptionist said only 1 room is fully paid, and the other room needs to be paid. We booked 2 rooms at the same time online, and why would one room is fully paid, and one room needs to be paid?

I would suggest a good floor mopping. However, I would say that the laminate floors were a nice change from the typical carpeted hotel rooms that we are used to in our hometown area. We did not try the food at the hotel, so we cannot attest to its quality or lack of. I will say that the gift shop or concession area was not very well stocked with regard to snacks or food.

Parking lot here is large with some parts that appear to be metered. We parked under one of the hotel wings that stated that it was for hotel guests only, and ended up on a very tangential route across a 5th floor bridge to the main wing, without realizing we could have walked outside. The parking is $10 nightly. Easy check-in and beautiful lobby atrium with an impressive multi-level window facing Highway 7, which every floor can see through once you get off the elevator. Our room was a one bedroom suite with a king bed and a sofabed, with no kitchen but we did have mini-fridge. Everything was quite comfortable and new. We had a pretty view of the city facing north.   Biggest flaw I saw was the shower stall design. It is a stand-up stall with hand-held shower head. There is a glass wall that only covers one half of the stall - the other is completely open. Therefore I ended up having to position the shower head exactly down (it is quite flexible with adjusting, thank goodness) as so to not spray onto the bathroom floor, but still there was some water splashing out as I showered. I feel like less savvy or perhaps overweight guests would have more trouble with water splashing out. Why couldn't they just put a glass door to cover the gap?  In the area, Markham Civic Centre is across the street, and there are numerous eateries nearby - especially Chinese ones (hey, it's Markham!). They also have VIVA bus service that runs a block away. Extremely safe area at night. I will say this isn't convenient for trying to get downtown unless you enjoy commuting, either by car or GO bus.

The two ""negatives"" I would say are(1) that the room allegedly sleeps 4 (2 adults, 2 kids) but frankly the two beds were too small to fit two adults in one bed comfortably and (2) charging for parking is silly (although I think it was only around $10/day).   Pool is a little small but nice for kids who just want to cool off after a hot day.   Location is great - Whole Foods is a short drive away (with tons of GF options for our Celiac), easy access to some major roads (if you need to visit north of Toronto) and no sound issues with hall traffic or neighboring rooms.

It went from bad to worse from the moment we checked in. Despite a lovely wedding weekend, filled with lots of love, laughter and great food, the rooms in the main building felt old and musty; there was mold growing in between the tiles in the shower, the pipes would rattle quite loudly when hot water was used, the carpet in the living area was stained and dingy, there were scuff marks on the walls. Clearly, nothing like the pictures. Each day, sometimes twice a day, I would call or visit the front desk to ask if there was an upgraded room available in the Warden Tower. After repeatedly being told by the front desk that the hotel was fully booked and there were no rooms available in the Warden Tower, I left my phone number with the front desk with a note to let me know when one became available.   My husband checked into his own room a couple days later, and guess what?? A kitchen suite room WAS available. So he took it and gave it to me to use. I was delighted. Until...I got into the room, and realized there was not a full length mirror. Now, on any other occasion, this would not have bothered me. But, since I was getting married in the morning and needed to put a saree on, I really really needed a full length mirror. I called the front desk to ask if one could be brought up, and spoke to Archie Joseph, who told me that he would check with housekeeping and call me back. Two hours later, after no phone call, I called again. This time, I was wished ""good luck"" by the front desk staff who explained that housekeeping did not have one available. I asked to speak to a manager and was directed to her ""supervisor,"" once again, Mr. Joseph. Instead of offering a solution, Mr. Joseph proceeds to tell me that he gave me a room upgrade so I should be happy with that. At this point, I was beyond upset, as Mr. Thomas had not given me a room upgrade, but gave it to my husband. If all of the other rooms in the hotel have full length mirrors in them, then why did mine not have one? With absolutely no thanks to the hotel staff, my lovely family bought me a full length mirror in the morning, which saved the day! For those of you wanting a functioning kitchen suite in the Warden Tower, our fridge was broken and instead a mini fridge was plugged in. It did not matter to me on this particular weekend, but any other time, and it would have.   To summarize, please don't believe the pictures of the rooms, especially in the main building. We really should have checked the rooms in the hotel, before booking our nine plus rooms, as if we had, we would have gone down the street.",2,negative

I was very surprised I met the most obnoxious group of people in Canada, a country that I expect to be more advance. The group of people I met are parents of little hockey players who knocked on each other doors loudly, have their room doors open so other guests can hear all the noises, and their kids played hockey on the hallway up even after 10 pm. They stopped only after security came around midnight. But the loud banging of the door keep going on until 3 am. I hope this group I met is the only exception, and not a representation of the rest of hockey parent groups. When I talked to one of the occupant to have her door close, the answer I got ""Other guest have yelled at our kids. But they just kids"". What kind of answer is that? We brought those kids into the worlds, then we have the responsibility to show them what is right and wrong. I let my children be kids but I will never let them be disrespectful and inconsiderate to others. There are other guests trying to have their rest especially after 10 pm, it is very disrespectful that these kids are thought this type of behavior is okay. The rest of the hotel facility is great. The lady at the pool check-in is very nice. Just make sure when you arrive and check in, ask not be placed on the same floor with these type of disruptions.

It's understandable that urban hotels, where space is a premium, will charge for parking, but at this property it seems like a way to nickel & dime the customer. Aside from this, check-in was smooth. The room design of the suites was a bit off. Bathroom and bedroom space is somewhat tight. The living area of the suite was fairly spacious and the couch actually opens to a bed, so you could put a family of 4 in the room easily. They did provide televisions in both the living area and bedroom area. One very odd design was the glass windows that go towards the hallway. There are curtains, but it's an odd design and really doesn't add much. Rooms were clean and housekeeping service was okay. There is a lobby bar at the hotel and a business center.

417311253,markham\ca\181720\182903\417311253.html,Hilton Toronto / Markham Suites Conference Centre &amp; Spa,"We’ve been staying at this hotel for a year and a half now. We stay at least once a month, for 2-3 days. We were happy with those stays, so when it came time to book a longer stay (7 weeks), we decided to stay here. The long term stay rates were more competitive than AirBNB rates we could find, and the advantages were free breakfast, parking, high speed internet, pool, gym, etc.  The room was lovely, full kitchen (just a bit smaller sized appliances), housekeeping came in each day to take out garbage, make beds, and did a more thorough cleaning twice a week.  The big problem was the swimming pool. The gym and pool are not owned by the hotel – they’ve rented it out to Club Markham Fitness. Club Markham has the pool booked several times a day for aquafit classes (no hotel guests allowed in during this time, unless adults and paying to take the class). They also have oversubscribed fitness members, to whom they promise exclusive use of the pool.  Even though there are 2 dedicated lanes for laps (the rest is for leisure swimming), these members take over the entire pool. They push hotel guests out, especially those with kids who are just splashing around. You’ve got aggressive older gym members kicking kids, creating huge waves as they swim within inches of children, drowning them in water, etc. We basically gave up trying to use the pool after a couple of weeks.  The Operations Manager (Nick) showed no interest in fixing the situation. Neither did the Hotel Front Desk. Each said the other was responsible for the situation. I had numerous back and forths with Katryna (Front Desk Manager); she stated that she’d spoken to the hotel manager, and there was absolutely nothing they could do about it as the pool did not belong to them.  The hotel should not state that guests have access to a pool, when that access is very limited (almost non-existent for those with young children).   Front Desk was generally quite unresponsive about anything that went on during our stay. The washer and dryer broke (they only have 1 of each in the entire long-term wing of the hotel, so for over 50 suites, at best of times competitive to use) for almost a week. Multiple guests had to hound front desk to finally fix it. I was told by other long-term guests that the hotel always took ages to fix laundry issues. They wanted guests to have to pay housekeeping to do laundry (charging by the item! So a load of laundry would have cost around $100).  I also contacted Front Desk a few times about marijuana smells in the rooms (from the central ventilation and hallways – there are no windows in rooms that you can open, and it’s supposed to be no-smoking rooms), with no response.   This is by far an inferior long-term stay than I’ve had at other hotels. Perhaps because it’s the only hotel in Markham of it’s size and facilities, they don’t seem to care about customer service. Other hotels I’ve stayed at long-term will call to see how your stay is going, if you need help at check out, and certainly be responsive to complaints.   I would not recommend staying here for long-term stays. Short term is fine, but not long term, and certainly not long term with children. We will continue to stay her for short-term stays, as it’s a convenient location, and the only hotel of this size of it’s kind in Markham. But we will definitely use an AirBNB rental for our next long-term stay.  I would recommend if you have flexibility of location to consider other options in Richmond Hill (e.g. there’s a Hilton there), or the Edward Village (formerly Delta) is still a decent place (just without all the amenities).",3,negative

There is a pretty outdoor terrace where one can eat and relax with little fountains on the back. This area seems to be the hub of Markham.

Everything was extra, no included breakfasts or even parking (10$ plus tax a night) which I would have expected in such a suburban location.  Overall a pleasant experience.",3,negative

Everyone said the bed was comfortable and clean. They was impress by the modern look.  I stayed at the kitchen suite and I felt it look even newer then the Corner suite. I like the tiles they use in the Kitchen and living room area.   One of the best preps of this hotels is the access to the onsite health club. It was decent run and offered many different machines. The pool was nice and my friend enjoyed the Jacuzzi. We stayed 3 days 2 nights but unfortunately we had a busy schedule and only used the health club once. The health club have a few squash courts but we was too tire to use it. (Racket have a rental fees )  We was pretty quiet at this hotel it was so convenient to all the bars and restaurants, we did most of our drinking outside - 10 to 20 mins away.   Overall everyone like this location and was close to many Chinese restaurants and shopping center.  I would definitely stay here again if I am in the Markham area.  The cost of parking was only negative that I found at this location. I wish they would comp or discount that for Hilton Honors members",5,positive

We did not get the Executive floor for the first night but was able to switch to the 10th floor the second day. The suite was overall quite good and comfortable except the bathroom was quite small. The so called breakfast was only continental and you have to pay more for a full breakfast. The executive lounge is only opened until 9am and if you miss breakfast there you have to take it at the coffee shop.Also, the executive lounge is not open on the weekend which I found strange.  The laundry room has one machine and closes at 8pm so you have to do your laundry during the day time.  Overall, I'd say it's an OK hotel. But forget about paying extra for access to the executive lounge. It's not worth it, esp. if you're staying there during the weekend.

Check-in was efficiently taken care of by an exceptionally friendly employee. All staff on the front desk were smiling and pleasant, making for a positive start to the conference. We sat at the Atrium restaurant to grab a quick bite before going to our meeting. Our server was inattentive, often disappearing for chunks of time, serving tables who came after us prior to coming to our table, and then disappearing when it came time to ask for the bill. The salads that came out were overpriced and underwhelming. I would not recommend the Atrium. The menu is rather limited as well. This was probably the only dark spot on the entire stay at the hotel.  My room was upgraded, for some reason, to a suite. The suite was enormous, basically an apartment. It was in the short tower, apart from my colleagues, but I was totally fine with that. It offered me the opportunity to explore the hotel a little more. I also got to meet some interesting people on my floor. Once again, the staff that I met in my travels were outstanding. Everyone had a smile on their face and a pleasant hello as they passed. Our conference room was well laid out and afforded ample room for the number of people in attendance. The post-meeting spread was delicious and fresh, a mix of fresh fruits, cheeses, and crackers.  The organization of our meeting rooms for the second day of the conference was great, all workshops were easy to find. There were coffee and snacks for the attendees. The staff was a little short with me when I accidentally tried to take a coffee from the table of another conference group. I hadn't seen the table marker that differentiated between the two tables for our conference, which flanked this middle table. I am not really certain it should have mattered, but it did to them. On a positive, they did take their job of guarding the food very seriously. Breakfast and lunch were both delicious and there was a lot of food to go around. The hotel catered to the numerous dietary restrictions beautifully. We did have one overly zealous bus person who attempted to take out dishes away even though we hadn't finished eating or drinking. I understand the desire for efficiency, but it is a little annoying when you are trying to enjoy your morning coffee.  Overall, if I were to rank the few hotels I stayed in this year for conferences, this one would be at the top of my list. It wasn't right in the bustling metropolis of Toronto. The numerous services that were available in-house, the staff was great for the most part, and the rooms that were comfortable and very clean make the Markham Hilton Suites a hotel I can truly recommend.

256618937,markham\ca\181720\182904\256618937.html,Courtyard Toronto Northeast/Markham,"This hotel used to be a Holiday Inn. Prior to that it was Chimo.  As a Holiday Inn property it was tired beyond tired. Then along came Marriott…  A complete refurbishing inside and you must believe me when I tell you that apart from the shape of the hallways everything else is different.  A modern look throughout… Immaculately clean… and efficient to boot.  The hotel is divided into two different formats; one which occupies floors one through nine and the other starting at 10 upwards. Floor 10 and above is called TownePlace Suites... below is their Courtyard brand.  I stayed in the TownePlace version.  To start with, the location is excellent and convenient to Highway 404 which is also known as the Don Valley Parkway.  Parking: they have both indoor and covered although it's not heated. One difference from the previous management or ownership is that now they charge four dollars to park in the covered area. That will be a fee you'll be glad to pay when it's snowing outside!  Reception and greeting: excellent.  Free breakfast is available.  There is a bistro in the building, something that did not exist before.  There is a business centre located in the bistro area and of course it's all modern. There are separate computers in the hallway to print your boarding pass.  I recall having to do laundry in this building the last time I was here Holiday Inn) and in order to do so you had to actually walk beside the swimming pool (wet floors) to a dungeon like room at the back. That's all changed now with a separate room outside the pool area with modern washers and dryers.  It seems as if all the meeting rooms have been redone as well… with projection units hanging from the ceiling.  The rooms: The room I'm in is a king suite which also features a full kitchen. Unlike other formats out there, the room is smaller so you don't feel as if you're in an apartment but rather a small bachelor suite.   Because of the room size the TV is in a weird place… As far away from the couch as possible... So it would probably be a bit cumbersome to watch.  There are wall plugs, with a mini Power bar built into the wall over the desk. It should be noted that the desk would also be your dining room table… And the desk faces the wall so if you wanted to eat with someone you'd be sitting side-by-side. There is a little pull-out desk underneath the work desk which might serve as a small dining room table as well, however there's only one chair in the room anyway unless I suppose you move the table over to where the couch is... well, you get the idea. It is perfect though for one person for sure. I have no doubt though that they would bring another chair if you asked for one.  The kitchen is lined up against one wall so you'll find a full-size refrigerator, dishwasher, coffee maker, microwave, sink, dishes, and a two burner electric stovetop.  The beds are brand-new so very comfortable.  The couch in this room appears to have a pullout section…  Lots of shelving and drawer space.  The bathroom: the king suite has a walk-in shower enclosed in glass. Modern in appearance it has a curved front to it which on a downside makes the bathroom a tad narrow.  In order to save room they use a sliding door to get in and out of the bathroom.   Amenities in the bathroom are typical of Marriott… thick and thirsty towels, portable hairdryer and again their typical soap. No bathrobes or slippers available here.  Internet: powerful signal, no issues.  I did walk into the two Queen bed room and it's missing the couch and it had a regular size bathtub instead of the shower stall.  They do have larger rooms as well…  Lighting: excellent.  The front desk staff actually took the trouble to call me when I took possession of the room to make sure it was happy and, during my stay called again to make sure everything was okay. A nice touch…  Thanks to Michelle and Islam. Both very professional and helpful people…  There is a spa in the hotel as well as a nicely furnished fitness center. A small market area to buy snacks…  For those who prefer do do some shopping, there is a (small) shopping centre (mall) about five minutes away from here on Steeles, as well as plenty of restaurants on Woodbine.  Would I stay here again?   Absolutely and with no hesitation.",5,positive

All in all, if I am visiting the Markham area again (probably next year for skating again!!) I would absolutely stay in this hotel.

It was nice to be in a hotel that had modern decor throughout. Our room was comfortable and very quiet - it had a thick, solid door so we didn't hear a sound from people in the hall and there was zero street noise. The view was not attractive, but we chose this hotel for the location and the quality exceeded our expectations. Parking was very affordable (not always the case in the Toronto area), and the rate was one of the best in the region. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, it felt very safe, the air conditioner was quiet, and the staff were friendly and polite. I'm not sure if all the room are the same, but ours had a stand-up shower that was great, but if you're looking for a room with a tub, you may want to look elsewhere.
 
 
 Room Tip:  If you need a bath tub, ask first - not all rooms have one.

We often stay at Courtyards when road tripping through the States. The one north of Times Square Manhattan is one of my favs in NYC. The chain is a ""high moderate"" and offers nice finishes, good beds and great breakfasts (with caveat!). I found the service very welcoming, friendly and helpful as we had to extend our stay a number of times at the last minute.  One of my favourite things about this Marriott brand is the breakfast. Where else on the planet can you get a good breakfast of freshly prepared eggs, potatoes and bacon AND Starbucks coffee. I've often joked that I would like to go Courtyards just for their breakfasts. However, I'm not sure when this happened, but 2 things disappointment me on this visit. First, the ""speciality"" coffee was extra. So I had to pay out of pocket for my Vanilla Latte and the others for my family. That's a bit of spending unplanned for. After that hurdle, everyone thought that the drinks tasted a bit off and we figured it was a powder drink and not a real expresso based drink. Now that is a rip off!  So a tip to myself for my next Courtyard consideration: add the cost of breakfast sans coffee to the room and see if it still makes financial sense to stay. I still love the breakfast and the chain. Just REALLY wished they didn't cheap out. Hopefully, this is just in Canada!

The hotel, as mentioned, is newly renovated, modern, well decorated, extremely clean in all details, with friendly, attentive desk clerk service. The room was very large, even by North American standards. In addition to a king-sized bed, there was a sofa with a large ottoman, and still plenty of space for bags and to move around. There were also plenty of free plugs for charging: I counted as least 10 in the room itself, not including the three USB ports. Common areas are spacious and well renovated (I stayed when it was a Holiday Inn and the Courtyard Marriott is much nicer), and there's even inexpensive coin-operated laundry, which I didn't expect but was a nice bonus in hot weather. And, as mentioned, the location is great: within walking distance to banks, shops, restaurants, groceries, etc. and five minutes to Fairview Mall (subway), Pacific Mall, and the 401.

The staff was considerate in allowing the parents to quietly gather in the bistro area to discuss game strategies once the team had settled in for the evening. We'll be back for our next tournament!

The only suggestion might be that the pool temperature was quite cold, especially for young children. The hotel is located significantly outside of Toronto, especially depending on traffic. Going into the city took about 45 minutes on a Sat evening, but coming home only took about 12 minutes. There were many convenient restaurants nearby for easy access to food.

Make sure you book a rate that includes breakfast, it's really worth it!!!",5,positive

Check in staff were friendly and fast and the rooms are newly furnished and spacious. The only complaint we had was that the TV in our room did not work during one of our stays and it took a good part of an hour to get it fixed; which seemed rather inconvenient as we checked in at almost 11pm and wanted to watch the late news. We cannot comment on the other amenities as we only had an overnight after our trips on both occasions. Otherwise definitely a recommended hotel around the Toronto area.

This is a high value property with excellent staff and clean comfortable rooms. The fitness center is large with good equipment but it also needs a few exercise/stretching mats.

While the hotel was clean, we weren't overly impressed with several factors.  - $5 per night for parking. Yes, it's only $5. But its not a downtown hotel, so to nickle and dime customers for parking is ridiculous. - front desk would not bring up 15 paper cups we requested for our hockey girls. We were told blunty ""we are not a full service hotel"". Considering our team was paying over $6000 for our stay, we would have thought paper cups could have been brought up - no toilet paper, despite several requests for one of our room members - housekeeping missed cleaning 2 rooms one day, calls had to be made - restaurant was poor. Sold out of romaine lettuce for a caesar salad (???), the next night the kale salad was sold out. The next night I ordered the Asian salad and it looked like a small bag of plain coleslaw emptied into a container. Awful. - no in-room movies, like normal hotels provide, or DVD players to rent.

A very low rate for the night ($119 + tax = <$135) and the local special included breakfast and parking - so it was great value. We went to The School nearby, which is a first class fine dining restaurant, if you're interested in a great meal. The hotel room was solid and the included breakfast was surprisingly delicious. We had a choice of either a hot breakfast (I had scrambled eggs, sausage and homefries) or some pastries and yoghurt etc., along with Starbucks coffee, which was better than the standard buffet. So, all good on the main things.  Only one ugly thing. When we checked in, a guest was having an argument with the check-in staff. Seems something went wrong with her reservation and the check-in staff kept saying ""I know. Really frustrating. There's nothing we can do."" The guest said that it had happened before to her every time she booked the hotel so she ended up leaving and going to another hotel - obviously really upset. I tried to ignore it, hoping to focus on a nice evening with my wife.  Then my check-out person starts giving me a similarly hard time. Says I have to pay for parking unless I can prove otherwise. I show him my phone with the booking, which I made through Marriott. He stares at it for far too long. I eventually ask, a bit rudely I admit, ""Can you read the words?"" They say ""Parking and Breakfast Package"" and show parking is included. Pretty clear in my books. He says ""Watch your tone."" Starts giving me a lecture - too long, and not appreciated. Then he points out an asterisk at the bottom that shows that parking costs $5 - which I assume is just part of their boilerplate. I don't think anyone would assume it applies to the ""Parking and Breakfast Package"" unless they're looking for a fight. He was. He wanted to show me how capable and wise he was - and was really trying to find a way to put me in my place. He also was trying to show off to the trainee beside him, who had turned away the previous guest (clearly she was getting the training this guy was trying to provide). Only thing is, I tell the guy, I'm the customer. The one who pays his salary. So he should be looking for a way to make me happy - not annoyed.  And for the other poor guest, there was lots they could have done. Give her the room she booked months in advance. Give her a better one. Make her room cheaper or free. Give her a free meal. Instead they just said over and over ""there's nothing I can do"". Until she left.  Ugly.  If you're reading this, I recommend you go elsewhere.",3,negative

I had booked a guest king sofa bedroom type which is what I usually book when I'm at this hotel. After I had checked in and went to the room I realized that it wasn't the right room type plus it was an adjoining room(maybe it was an error). I went to front desk and the woman who had checked me in (I think her name was Bonnie) was very quick at fixing the issue to find an available king sofa bedroom type but there wasn't any available, which she then gave me a complimentary upgrade to a suite. I really appreciated the upgrade and my guest and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay very much! What was more important to me was that she was very polite, quick and was very accommodating. I have not experienced any major issues during my stays and if I needed something like extra towels, extra tissues/toilet paper etc, they have always been prompt and accommodating. I did not have any issues with a room not being clean or hot water taking long as I've stayed multiple times on high floors or TV not working.

The hotel was a last minute booking and so I lucked out by being a Marriott rewards member and got a GREAT deal on the nightly room rate. The hotel doesn't look like much on the outside and doesn't stand out, however I was pleasantly surprised upon entry. It was clean and bright and buzzing with people checking in and out. It looks like the hotel recently went through renovations as the lobby was state of the art and the hotel itself did not look aged at all.   I was thanked for being a rewards members and ushered to my room quite swiftly. The rooms are very big and allow a lot of light, had a great seating area and featured nice wall design above the headboard.  Parking: $5/night - which was surprising for the area but still not a huge expense. Dining- There was a restaurant/Bar area that looked very inviting as well as a quick little convenience area beside the main reception which provided a lot of food options for travellers on the go!  Spa/Pool I wasn't aware until check in that there was a spa and pool, had I know this I wouldn't have booked a treatment at the Hilton nearby. This just gives me a reason to come back and visit.   Location: A very good location as it has direct access to every highway (404/DVP. 401).

I'm not sure why they do that, because it's a bit confusing when you are booking. The two chains are Towneplace Suites and Courtyard Marriott. Towneplace Suites offers a free breakfast (hot and cold) with the room whereas Courtyard Marriott does not.  I had originally booked a suite with Towneplace Suites before we arrived at a great rate of $84/night for two nights.  When we arrived, the person at the front desk informs us that the suite we booked was only available for one of the nights we are staying. He asked if we'd be willing to switch to the Courtyard room. Apparently the room rate was more but he was willing to honor the rate I booked online, as well as include the free breakfast. He even waived our parking fee and gave my kids free soda from the mini lobby store. We were fine with this since it was only for two nights.  The room was very nice and clean. The decor of the room was very modern. We had two Queen sized beds, which were comfortable. The flatscreen tv was mounted on the wall above a desk. There was only two drawers for clothes, but at least there was a small closet that housed the mini fridge and had shelves to put clothes in too. We were able to store our luggage in another big closet with hangers too.  The bathroom was nice too. It had a sliding door that does not lock. There were glass doors for the shower. Plenty of towels available.  The view from our room was of the parking lot and Woodbine Ave. The property was huge. We parked our rental car in the parking garage, which was on two levels and had an elevator that accessed the lobby.  Breakfast was served on the 14th floor. You needed a room key card in order to access the different floors. You also needed the Towneplace key card to access the room with the breakfast. The room wasn't very big and when it's crowded there aren't many seats. The food was decent. Typical eggs, sausage patties, oatmeal, bread and bagels, do-it-yourself Belgian waffles, hard boiled eggs, cereals, etc. The dining area has two tvs mounted on the wall streaming local news.  One tip is that there are two banks located next door to the hotel so you can get local currency if you're from the US like we are.  I'd recommend this hotel.

I thought maybe it would be shampoo or the soap that we used.. but no they told me after we check-out the cleaning lady goes in to clean and verify what was used, so apparently we drank the two water bottle.  I do not mind paying for what I used even if it was 100$. But changing me for something I didn't consume and they cannot do anything about it. It shows that they don't care about their customer.  Another side note, my sister stayed there in August 2015 and had bedbug problem. She file a complaint and they never replied. I thought I would give them a chance since my brother stayed there as well and didn't have a problem. But 2 out of 3 of us stayed and had a problem and they didn't resolve it.

391449612,markham\ca\181720\182904\391449612.html,Courtyard Toronto Northeast/Markham,"Stayed at the Courtyard July 8-9th for son's ball tournament. Hotel very nice and clean. So awesome to be at a hotel that doesn't have THAT SMELL, you know the smell. Check-in and check-out was fast and easy with polite front desk employees. Room modern with everything you would want. Included hot breakfast scrambled eggs sausage fruit juices breads pastries cereal etc. Good variety to please anyone. Only thing I wish is that they would of had a room for team to hang at downstairs in lobby as they don't allow outside alcohol as they have a bar there. I just figure instead of peeps hanging in someone's room it would be better to have us downstairs by lobby they can keep an eye on us and no chance of disturbing anyone in next room. We were a group of about 12, very respectful and not loud however even just normal conversation could have disturbed someone in next room. It all worked out in the end with a great weekend stay. Not a lot of restaurants walking distance but no biggie. There normally is a parking fee but being with the team it was included. Just wish no hotels would charge for parking. Would definitely stay again and recommend this hotel.",4,positive

Rooms were modern, clean, smelled nice and had all of the amenities you would expect with a Marriott - mini refrigerator, ample closet space, etc. The bathroom was large and updated. Parking was $5 (not sure why they wouldn't just include this with the overall cost of the room but whatever.). The only thing that really disappointed me was the breakfast... We chose to order at the ""Bistro"" and were very disappointed - the food was clearly frozen/reheated. It was disappointing to say the least.

394454213,markham\ca\181720\182904\394454213.html,Courtyard Toronto Northeast/Markham,"I was a guest at the Holiday Inn hotel at this location for many years during my frequent visits to the Markham, ON area. So I was eager to see what this hotel would be like for my family of four to visit after its lengthy renovation and conversion into a Courtyard Marriot property.  My first impression was good. The lobby was well designed, and the room itself felt upscale. The bathroom of my Queen Studio room had a walk-in shower with a sliding glass door instead of the typical shower-tub-with-shower-curtain setup. It looked luxurious. My room being a studio room, I had hoped for a bit more space than typical double-queen rooms. But to be honest it was no larger than a typical double-Queen. The room was the typical narrowish rectangle, and the only sign of a ""studio"" room was that the desk had a attached desk panel that swung out, so that you had an L-shaped workstation if you wanted to do a lot of work in a comfortable business setting. The beds were firm but comfortable, if surprisingly high. Overall the room was clean and felt good. One bonus that was nice was the nearly full-sized refrigerator, with a good sized freezer. This nice refrigerator-freezer allowed me to buy and store ice creams and popsicles for my kids during my week-long vacation. So far, so good.  Then the not-so-good things started to surface. First of all, the sliding door to the bathroom wouldn't lock. Was it broken? No. An examination of the door shows that the locking mechanism had been removed. I called the front desk, and they confirmed that every single room in the hotel had its bathroom door lock removed, because apparently they had an incident where some guest got locked in the bathroom by accident. So the hotel's response was to make all doors not lockable. This was nuts. What if some guest got locked in his room by accident? would the hotel's solution be the act of removing every door to every room so anyone could walk freely in and out of every room? It seemed to me that the right thing to do was to fix the lock of the room with the bad incident. At worst, they should redesign the locks so that the accident locking-in incident could not longer happen. To me this is like chopping off the whole foot to address a sprained toe. My wife, who likes her privacy, found this set-up to be extremely uncomfortable.   Other problems cropped up as well. The housekeeping staff never seemed to want to resupply the toilet paper. So my family of four had to either ration out a partial roll of paper or call down to get a spare roll. I had to call down 4 times during my 7 day stay so that my family could use the bathroom without anxiety.   This hotel has free Wi-Fi, which you can use without any password. Besides the iffy security issue of using a Wi-Fi network which is totally unsecured, I found that the Wi-Fi availability was pretty sporadic. Sometimes, my laptops and devices had access to full Wi-Fi as soon as I entered the hotel's lobby. Other times, I couldn't get access no matter how often I tried to get the Wi-Fi with my devices. So be advised that this could be a problem if getting online is actually necessary if you are a business traveler.  I was on the 10th floor, and getting downstairs during the morning turned out to be a chore. The hotel had 3 elevators, and during the afternoon and evening the elevators came after a reasonable wait. But in the mornings, during checkout times, you could not get an elevator. When we finally found room to get in, and the elevator made its way down to the lobby, the elevators stopped on every floor and guests with luggage carts and a million bags tried to cram into the car. Usually by the time we reached the 6th floor, the people who tried to get in from that floor and down were out of luck, because we were already crammed in like sardines in the elevator car. It was not a pleasant experience by any stretch.   During my previous stays at this property when it was still the Holiday Inn, I noted that bus loads of traveling groups often stayed at this hotel. This included high school sports teams, tourists from overseas, and others. I can attest that this tradition continues at the Courtyard today. On the Friday evening of my weeklong stay, a bus stopped out front and unloaded a large number of kids in their late teens carrying what appeared to be hockey equipment bags. From the moment on, for the evening, and then the next morning, the elevators were full of people. The hallways were full of excited teenagers running around excitedly. They went up and down the floors visiting their friends. To be fair, the kids were polite and well behaved enough that they were not particularly loud or offensive in any way. But, the fact was that the hotel suddenly felt very crowded. Until the kids went to bed, you could hear them outside your rooms, chatting in the corridors and generally being kids. Again, I have no real problem with those kids. But there were many of them and you could feel their presence wherever you went in the hotel. If you are fine with that, then it's not a problem. But if you prefer not to be in a hotel environment where every elevator car you enter has a bunch of teenagers squeezing inside, then this might not be the best fit for you.  My overall conclusion is that the new Courtyard by Marriott located on Woodbine Ave will not become a repeat destination for me. I travel to this area for vacation at least once or twice every year, and I am familiar with quite a few other hotels in this price range that offers better amenities, a more comfortable atmosphere, and an overall more enjoyable experience. I wouldn't say I had an awful stay. But on my next trip I will be booking with a different hotel.

I got upgraded to the suite, which is very nice. This is my first time staying and I thought I find another great hotel that I can return to. But turn out it's okay to stay for a night.  The cons are they had a wifi issue during my stay. We were told to call the troll free number ( overseas call center) to get help. And as expected, it was no help. We wasted over half an hour on the phone and still couldn't figure out the issue. The front desk staff told us due to that day the hotel has a full occupancy, so their wifi cannot support all customers' devices.   That excuse is so lame. So when they put the equipment in, they do not expect the hotel will have full occupancy ?   I was lucky that I do not need my laptop that day and I use my own data for my phone. But I cannot imagine if I have to stay more than one night.   The bathroom is nice and new. But there are not enough hooks or hangers for the towels. Our room only has one hook right about the toilet bowl. It is kind of disgusting to hang something here, I think.   I will come back to Toronto soon.

It sounded like living next to a motocross track.No sound insulation from the windows. Could hear some conversation in the rooms next door. To top it off - the toilets are wonderfully high efficiency but flush with the sound of a jet engine. And you can hear your neighbors flush too. The other big issue is getting around the hotel. This hotel is huge and there are three elevators that you have to use. Stairs are not an option from/to the lobby.

Warning - in room mini ""fridge"" is really just a mini-bar, and doesn't really keep things cold. With three kids, we had packed juice boxes, cheese, sandwich fixings, etc. because it said there was a fridge, but it barely kept things cool. Once we realized this, we kept the things needing to be cold in the cooler with lots of ice. On checkout, the desk clerk said they will gladly take any perishable food and put it in a bag with our room number and put it in their fridges, so keep that in mind.  Pool is an even 4 ft. deep the entire length--not great for smaller children or those who are strong swimmers and want to do diving, etc. Our kids thought it was great. We brought our pool floaters for our kids (ages 10, 8 & 4) as we figured there wouldn't be any already at the pool, and we were right. Whirlpool was perfect.   Breakfast buffet a big hit with us - attentive staff, good food--a nice selection of breakfast items including cereals, muffins, danishes, banana loaf, croissants, mini-donuts, fruit salads, cut fruits, yogurt, cottage cheese, 4 or 5 different juices, eggs, bacon, sausages, home fries, bagels, toast. Breakfast was available until 10:30, so we went down around 9 and had a leisurely breakfast that kept us full until suppertime.  We had a nice time at the Radisson for our short family get-away and would recommend it for the value.",5,positive

We paid a very reasonable price for the room, breakfast and our tickets to the Science Centre. My husband and I have stayed in Deltas across Canada, and found Delta Markham to be not quite up to Delta standards. While the lobby was decorated in a modern style, I found it to be cold and uninviting...it looked as if it was done quickly and was waiting to be finished. The chairs and couches situated around the fireplace looked hard and stark...not somewhere that I would want to sit and relax. The pool area was very dirty- there was hair all over the deck, and it looked as if people had been walking around in their boots. It could have done with a good scrubbing. Both the pool and hot tub had an insane amount of chlorine- our whole family felt itchy after our swim. The beds in the rooms were very comfortable, but we found an empty water bottle in the room on check in. The shower pressure was good, but the shower was tiny, and we had to struggle with the shower curtain to keep it from sticking to us. The staff was very friendly, and we had a wonderful hot buffet in the morning. We also appreciated the free parking. All in all, this is a decent hotel, but something needs to be done to bring it up to the Delta standards people come to expect. It still feels like a Radisson!",3,negative

The lobby is newly renovated since our last stay and looks nice. Check in was smooth but also did not receive anything special for the kids. We had a premier room and I can't imagine what the difference is from a standard room except maybe the bathrobe and a CD player. The room was tired and needed an update. We had a 27' older TV that I haven't seen in a hotel room for a while now. Flat screen HD anyone??? It was mostly clean except the hair under the covers of one bed. Had a microwave, small fridge and coffee maker that all worked fine. Didn't eat here as the breakfast was too much money in my opinion.   All in all, for the amount we paid, the place was fine. Was it as good as I remember?? No, not really. Rooms (at least ours) are in need of some updating. Would I recommend this hotel to others?? I suppose, but there are many choices in the area as well to consider.   Oh one more thing. I give bonus points for free parking and the in room wireless internet was great and fast.

103559992,markham\ca\181720\182906\103559992.html,Delta Markham,"Had the opportunity to stay at the Delta Markham for 4 nights recently, and unfortunately this particular Delta hotel did not measure up to my stays at other hotels in the Delta chain. Before booking the room, I checked the Delta website to see the different room types. Their website listed a Delta Room and a Premier room - the only difference on the Delta website was that the more expensive Premier room had additional ammenities. These included an in-room microwave and an iPod docking station among other things. The major issue for me, was the inclusion of a microwave with the Premier Rooms as we were traveling with our 2-year old and this would allow us to heat up small snacks for her. Before booking a room, I sent an email via Delta's website asking about the hotel's bed type. There had been some mention of Sleep Number beds in the hotel although the Delta website only mentions their Delta Sanctuary beds. Having visited other Delta hotels in the past, I can tell you that their Sanctuary beds are very comfortable. Sleep Number beds are adjustable with respect to softness - a novel idea but in practice, not the best of beds. Don't get me wrong - they are decent beds - I just would prefer another type if given a choice. A Delta customer service rep replied by email telling me that the Delta Markham had both Sleep Number beds and newer Sanctuary beds. I was told that rooms were being upgraded to Sanctuary beds but currently some Delta type rooms at this hotel still had Sleep Number beds. Therefore, with the microwave and Sanctuary Beds available in the Premier type room, I made an online reservation for 4 nights in a Premier room with 2 queen beds. Upon arrival at the hotel, we entered our room to find only 1 queen bed. The room, other than a missing bed was very nice (flat screen TV, chocolates on the bed). Went down to the front desk and was told that the Delta Reservations did not indicate that I had booked a 2-bed room. I showed her my reservation confirmation slip, which clearly indicated I had reserved a 2 queen bed Premier room. They said they would do their best to accomodate us and after some room and floor changing we settled into a new room with 2 beds only to find no microwave in the room. They offered to bring up a microwave for the room the next day to prevent us from moving to yet another room, which was fine with us after a long day of traveling. After settling in, we noticed a couple of things that indicated to me that we were not in a Premier Room as I paid for, but rather a Delta Room. The missing microwave, missing iPod dock both indicated Delta Room. Furthermore, the 2 beds in the room were Sleep Number beds. As the microwave was our main concern, we didn't bother worrying about the other issues. The microwave was delivered to the room the next day as promised. Upon checkout, I mentioned to the front desk that we were in a Delta Room and not the Premier Room I had booked and paid for and asked for a credit for the difference in room cost. I had paid almost $500 for the 4 nights. I was told that our room was in fact a Premier Room and not a Delta Room as it had appeared. I questioned the fact that the room was missing a microwave and iPod dock. I was told that not all Premier Rooms have microwaves and iPod docks (completely opposite of what the Delta Markham website says). When I mentioned what the website detailed, I was told that the website was wrong. I then questioned the Sleep Number beds in the room and the fact that the Delta rep had emailed me details of how Premier Rooms had the Sanctuary Beds and only some Delta rooms stil had Sleep Number beds. I was then told that the rep was wrong. Rather than argue the point at checkout, I followed up with the Delta Guest Relations department when I returned home. I was told that the website details and the Delta rep who replied by email were both incorrect and they were in the process of correcting the website information. I was still confused as to the difference then between a Delta Room and a Premier Room and why the Premier Room was more expensive if the amenitities were the same. I was told that in general, some Delta hotels offer such things such as free local calls, WIFI etc for Premier Rooms. Unfortunately, I could not get any specifics as to the difference in room types at the Delta Markham and why there would be 2 different prices if the room ammenities were the same. Remember, the website lists free local calls and WIFI on both room types - the only difference listed is the iPod dock and microwave on the Premier Room type - but these details are supposedly inaccurate according to Delta. It's been a couple of weeks now and the website still shows the same (allegedly inaccurate) information. I was offered a refund of the difference between room types for my stay or a complimentary 1-night return stay. While the 1-night stay was of greater value, I chose to take the refund of the difference. I travel to this area frequently for business and leisure, but I doubt I'd return to the Delta Markham even if it was ""free"" (just in case ""free"" was somehow ""inaccurate"" too...).  Aside from this experience, here are some details and opinions about the hotel if you are considering staying here. Rooms are in need of updating - there's no doubt about this. The initial room we were checked into seemed to have nicer ammenities such as the flat screen TV, etc (probably a Premier room), but the furniture was stil very dated. The room we ended up in was even worse. The furniture was the same old, dated and tired white wood (check out the hotel photos - those are the better rooms' furniture and it still is dated). The TV was a archaic monster box circa 1970. The lounge chair had a huge stain that we ended up placing a towel over the entire stay so our 2-year old wouldn't touch it. One of the floor lamps was broken and didn't work (not a burnt out bulb but a broken switch). My sleep number bed had a remote that didn't work, so I was stuck at whatever setting it was at (yup, this was the salt in wound after expecting a Sanctuary bed). The room itself was very spacious and had a vanity area outside of the bathroom. Bathrooms looked to have been updated recently, which was nice. Showers are somewhat narrow and they use a straight curtain rod, so expect to be ""attacked"" by the shower curtain when showering. Key cards were a bit of a pain - they kept not working and we had to go several times to the front desk to reset them. We were told they were sensitive to metal so not to keep them with your keys. However, we left one key in the room nowhere near metal and it too didn't work the next day. Pool was nice and there was a whirlpool there as well. Didn't eat at the restaurant. Parking was free and the WIFI had a good fast connection. Staff were very friendly and pleasant and the lobby was recently renovated.  Overall, it's not a bad hotel but my experience has kind of killed chances of me returning there. Which is a real shame considering my stays at other Delta Hotels have always been very positive and comfortable. Would I tell you not to stay there? No, I wouldn't but it's an average hotel in great need of room renovations. There are other hotels in the area for less or the same money that are much nicer and more modern. Traveling with my 2-year old for 4 nights, the microwave was the selling point in booking at the Delta Markham. In the end, it wasn't worth the headache. Whatever you do, don't pay extra for the Premier Room because no one seems to know why it costs more than the regular Delta Room and the ammenities are apparently the same. I'd suggest checking the Delta website, but I'd hate for you to get inaccurate information.",3,negative
114258458,markham\ca\181720\182906\114258458.html,Delta Markham,"The hotel is located at the corner with Hwy 7 and just west of the 404 but inside the hotel you won't hear any traffic noise at all. You will definitely need a car to get around since there isn't much in the immediate neighbourhood except for low rise office buildings and what look like warehouses. The area is clean, well maintained and projects a rural atmosphere. Parking lot is clean and well lit. Front desk staff is courteous and efficient.   I think this hotel is targeted at the weekeday business traveler who is willing to pay a little more for better accomodations. This leaves behind pleasure travellers like me to enjoy above average accomodations at up to 25% off on weekends (sometimes more with the advance-pay non-refundable rate). This is my third stay and I'll be back next time.  The room was of average size, had a work desk with a reclining office chair. There were a couple of other chairs and a drawer chest. The room was tastefully decorated. The mattresses were thick and plush and had a firmness adjustment system. Each bed had a plush duvet and plenty of pillows. The room and hallways were clean and odour free.   We had a slight issue with the guests next door. It sounded like they had 3 young children who returned to the room at midnight after enjoying the pool. Needless to say they were quite boisterous. When they didn't settle down after 30 minutes, I called the front desk. Within moments, I heard their phone ring and they went quiet soon after. That was excellent response time by the front desk.

I was expecting to get the Holiday Inn, but I figured that I would be getting a different hotel when my lower bids were not being accepted.  The lobby of the Delta Markham was quite minimalist. The front desk was glassy and illuminated, and I had to make sure it was actually a front desk before approaching. Check-in was quick, and there was a vase full of apples nearby for a nice snack. The swimming pool area was located right beside the front desk.  Our room (1109) was a standard room with two queen beds, an older tube TV and a desk. There was also a small kitchenette with an old microwave and an even older refrigerator that we nearly mistook to be a safe.  We had a south view overlooking the overflow parking lot and the industrial park surrounding the hotel. Further off in the distance was the 407 Express Toll Route. There were several strip malls in the area with just about every fast food restaurant being a short drive away.  Complimentary high-speed Internet was available in the room. However, I didn't bring my computer with me so I went to the business centre on the second floor instead. Unfortunately, Internet there was a pay service so I went without checking my e-mail.  Markham is a rather unremarkable destination, and the Delta Markham blends in from the outside. Still, the stay and the service were definitely worth the stop.",3,negative

Some rooms seemed to have had new tvs and new fridges. The front lobby is very nice and inviting. The staff at the front desk were very helpful and friendly. The cleaning staff did an excellent job.

The waitress I had my first night was good, but a lot of people from our company complained they got poor service. The bartender could stand to be a bit friendlier, but he was fairly prompt.  The pool area is not very attractive. I found ants in the sauna. The hotel restroom was not in great condition. In general the hotel restaurant does not look very modern at all. There was a nice courtyard that you look out into , but not seating in the courtyard.  The staff was great that I dealt with and this is most likely the cleanest hotel in the area. Generally I would recommend this hotel if you are there for business. It was quiet and they have internet included and a parking lot.   I did not use the conference area ,but that area was very attractive and up to date when I had a peak at it.",3,negative

My preference is for the Delta chain in Canada and this hotel delivers what one would expect from Delta. Tends to be more business oriented and wireless can be somewhat flaky at times. With a very good restaurant area a 5 minute drive away, I have only had breakfast at the hotel. Breakfast is on par for most hotels, can be expensive and a la cart is a better bet than the buffet unless you are a big eater. Parking is included, good central location for business in this area and close to highways if you are traveling around the city. Not sure I would use this as a base for family vacations. This is an update Howard Johnson's hotel so there is a slightly dated feel and some of the rooms are on the smaller side.

A bit odd to still find CRT televisions but a minor quibble, I didn't get the chance to avail myself of the pool on this trip, spending my time instead at the Wave Pool, a significant local attraction. The staff were friendly and professional although they dropped the ball when the shift changed.

Quickly went down again to recheck the room I was given and have the room written in the key card holder corrected and key card retool and this time I got my room ... all 25 minutes.  Room provided is a double queen and pretty clean with decent washroom and toilettries. Quite business like with free wifi. The hotel is located right in front of Highway 7 so not much of a view in all directions ... my room was facing the industrial park in the rear.  The lobby is pretty dated and not really inviting with the receptions well inside the lobby area after the elevators. Stayed here only one night so did not test out the in house facilties. One thing I can say for the price shown on their booking site it is very competitive compare to any of the 3 star hotels in the Markham vicinity.

The hotel has an indoor pool, sauna, whirlpool and gym. I used all 4 and I would rate their condition as average. The pool area could use some remodeling.   The rooms were spacious and included a refrigerator which was convenient. Our room was clean and the beds were comfortable. Our room had a Sleep Number bed.

I've stayed at 3 or 4 properties in Markham and they are all pretty dull. I was very disappointed with the workout facility / gym at this particular hotel. There were weights missing and the treadmill was not working. My advise is if you have a car and are in Markham for business is to stay downtown Toronto (this is what I've started doing). Way better selection of hotels, many more things to do in the evening, and a quick 20+ min drive back to Markham in the morning (because you are going against traffic on the DVP).

Booked through Priceline for a King with Sofabed, when I called to tell them we would be a late check-in they told me they had upgraded me to a Deluxe room because the King/Sofa was unavailable so though slightly inconvenient it was a fair trade.   Check in was very busy as the hotel was sold out but staff was professional and friendly during check in but it was still very slow. Asian guests kept pushing into the line and staff helped them first. Annoying but again not a deal breaker. BUT waiting to check in was nothing compared to the wait for the elevators. I can not express how slow they are. I waited 5 minutes, not exaggerating, to get an elevator.  Room was nice, bed was comfy, everything was clean. Pillows were horrible and about 6 inches thick which does not work for a stomach sleeper. I called down and NO ONE answered. I have never stayed in a hotel where no one answers when you dial '0'. Tried to make due with the pillows and finally with a kink in my neck called down at 3 am and was told there were no other pillows, staff member, Chris I believe, was very rude and it felt like he was rushing me off the phone. Had a terrible sleep and woke up with a serious kink and went down to front desk to complain. Was told they in fact had lots of feather pillows and they were not sure why he did not offer me those. Benjamin said they would be in our room by the time we got back. They weren't. Called down, NO ONE answered, called back, NO ONE answered and finally on the third try got someone who sent them up. Not really impressed.   The pool was awesome. very clean. BUT no towels. told the guy at the desk and he said he'd get some there. 1/2 hour later still no towels. Walked to the elevator dripping wet carrying my daughter. Waited 5 mins freezing my butt off for the incredi-slow elevator. Went down to the pool next day and again no towels. Told the guy, 1 hour later still no towels. Kind of ridiculous.   The restaurant is very good, room service meal, I had the Club, was delicious. Breakfast buffet was only $14.95, which if you have stayed at any other Delta is very reasonable, and it was pretty good for standard buffet fare.   Overall the stay was average. The room was nice, the restless sleep with a pillow as thick as a couch cushion was not. The food was good, the customer service was not. The pool was good, no towels was not. At this point I am not sure I would return unless it was a great deal as at full price I would not be happy at all.

I have stayed in many hotels but the Delta Markham was one of the best I have stayed in for a number or reasons. When I booked the Delta Markham, I was impressed by the price and value after much review. It was when we arrived at the hotel, the intrinsic value of the hotel increased significantly. The decor is simple and elegant. The people at the front desk, especially Narciso and Khrystyne, who were extremely pleasant and helpful. These two persons are exemplary and sterling examples of what customer service should be everywhere.  The room was adequate in size; what I would recommend is the upgrading of the television set to a flat screen; the microwave oven should not be optional but should come with every room; and there should be the option of requesting a DVD player to attach to the flat screen TV.

The beds are comfortable, the rooms are clean and spacious and have a window that can open for some fresh air. Unfortunately there is no safe in the room. One other thing i did find interesting is the bathroom. The bathtub and shower seems to made out of a solid plastic shell - one the first day I was actually disoriented standing in the shower because you do not see a single horzion - it's really weird (or maybe it was the jetlag).

But sometimes, it's the small things that makes the impression. We booked through Priceline for almost half the regular price, so it is understandable that we were given the best room, and we were not expecting one either. However, we were not asked of the preference on a smoking or a non-smoking floor, so we ended up on a smoking one. The absorbed smoked smell was clearly noticeable. We could have asked for a room change and probably get one, but that is beside the point if you were not asked of your preference in the first place.  The rooms are clearly clean, but shows signs of ageing and slight neglects. Fridge, microwave, and the adjustable beds are all nice touches, but it would be nicer if I did not have to move the furniture and plug them in myself. The fridge was powered by a Pelter cooler rather than compressor, so it was not too cold to start with. The ice around it made it totally unusable. I spent a good 15 min to defrost it in order to be able to use it.  The bottom line: A good hotel, but please sweat on the small stuff.

Although I had a room on the back side of the elevator shaft you would never know. I did not hear any noise except from the street far below. The king room was spacious, with an enclosed bathroom, built-in vanity desk across, and sliding door closet. Lighting was excellent throughout. The main bedroom had two upholstered chairs with ottoman, working desik & chair, dresser, refrigerator, and microwave. Housekeeping always left a bottle of water for the next morning, a very nice touch. And before bedtime my room was visited again to remove the decorative spread/pillow and leave a milk chocolate square. A unique but sturdy radio was provided as well as a loose hair dryer, iron/ironing board and the usual coffee set stocked for morning use. The bed was very comfortable with soft pillows. There was a dedicated AC unit in the wall and continuous fan. Although the bath fixtures were showing signs of wear on the chrome plating from daily cleanings, the short tight weave carpet was new and the room was very clean. The one piece fiberglass shower unit was immaculate, with good pressure, hot water, and a light in the shower. The exhaust vent worked superbly. A thicker carpet bath mat was provided at the sink comforted the feet during hygiene preparations. Everything was very well maintained.  The service was also superb; very friendly check-in and check-out (although the room receipt had already been slid underneath the door). Each guest is greeted during the evening with a general reception by the General Manager. The staff was dressed formally and looked, and acted very professional. Although I did not dine at the Trivoli restaurant, it was inviting and gave the appearance of a well run establishment. I only wished that my business schedule had not been so demanding so I could enjoy the stay longer.  I have absolutely no complaints; I would gladly stay here again.

The hotel has a nice and cozzy atmosphere with an attention to details that will not leave you untouched.  The rooms are always clean and are very well maintained.   The front-desk staff is highly professionnal and knowledgable and will do whatever it takes to accomodate your needs.  The restaurant and the lounge also deserves a lot of compliments. I am traveling a lot for work and often stays in hotel, which, can sometimes be a bit exhausting. This hotel has always been able to make me feel like home.... and this is worth a lot.  The bar/restaurant/lounge staff is extremely attentive to the customers needs and will always engage in a conversation with you, and remember  about you.  Th quality of the food is also an important factor in helping me feeling like at home. Whatever you feel like having, you can ask and they will make it happend, with the nice Delta touch.  Also, saying that I travel for work, also means that I forget stuff at home and they have always amazed me with that... They will go out of their way to accomodate you and you will never feel that it is a burden for them to do so.  The management team is also extremely professional and caring about their customer's needs and feed-back.   It really is one of my favorite place to stay, I highly recommend.

The front desk is understaffed but very friendly. We noticed both queen beds had several long hairs on the sheets and we were unable to call front desk about it as there was only one person there and she was too busy to answer the phones ( this was what she told us!). We had to take the elevator down to lobby to complain and she could not move us to another room as the hotel was booked but promised to have the sheets changed. Half an hour letter no one shows up so we call housekeeping again and they finally change the bedding and were very apologetic. The room smelled musty, was old fashioned and the tv was a tube tv!! The bathroom sink had mold growing under the rim and we took a picture to show it to Management. The light bulb in one of the lamps was not working, cordless phone was not working and the sleep number bed controls were not functional. The hotel manager came and replaced the bulb and moved the bed to make sure the bed controls were plugged in properly. He finally got to make it work just to have it stop working 15 minutes after he left.

173577695,markham\ca\181720\182906\173577695.html,Delta Markham,"Delta hotels is widely known for its superb guest experience. I've stayed at this hotel twice, and the cleanliness of this Delta chain hotel is the worst I've seen across the country. I'm a Delta gold member, and I've stayed at Delta hotels from Halifax, PEI to Vancouver, and most of them in Ontario. At the Delta Markham, I've never been so disappointed with not only my first stay, but also my second.  There are a few reasons as to why I was very unsatisfied with my stay. I reserved the premier suite both times, which is one of the end rooms with a full living area, seperate bedroom and kitchenette. First off, the room was not clean (to my standards, and to what I believe is Delta standards). What I've come to expect from the Delta is a spotless room, as if nobody has ever stayed in before - and all of them expect Markham is where I've had this experience). The chandelier hanging above the bathroom sink was full of dust, literally dripping of dust. It doesn't look like it was cleaned in months, maybe longer. The shower head was caked in hard water stains. The bathroom had visible human hair in a few places. This was found at my first stay, and also my most recent stay at the end of July this year. Too boot, on my second stay, I arrived and the room was not 100% cleaned. It looks as if the housekeeper did the bed, replaced the towels, but missed some very important aspects, such as the used soap and shampoo in the bathroom, the used face soap on the bathroom sink. Heck, even the key cards from the person before me were sitting on the desk.  I will never return to this hotel, and I do not suggest spending your hard earned Delta dollars at this place. Opt for the Delta Meadowvale in Mississauga or the Delta Airport West in Toronto, they are worth the extra $10-$20 that you will spend, but worth the satisfaction of a beauty room - and they are CLEAN.  I'm very surprised that this hotel holds the Delta logo on their building. I wonder when head office will wake up and realize they have an issue?

The server charged us full children's price for dinner. When I complained they reduced the 6 year old's to free but refused the half price child saying that that was only if he chose from the adult menu not the children's. Also noteworthy is that the pool and pool area is not handicap accessible and I have a problem with stairs.

Check-in was at ease, Veronica and Sara were both helpful at the front desk with answering my questions. I was disappointed the two rooms we got were not next to each other nor on the same floor, i understand they're busy and at their max capacity for labor day weekend, they should have been planned/organized ahead since I booked almost 3 weeks in advance, not sure if this was excusable. I was constantly going up and down the elevators, which do not seemed to come frequent enough after so many trips. Upon arrival to my room, i see a box of peaches that were rotten and molded, it must have been there for over a week and tells me the hotel does not value cleanliness. I opened the fridge to put in water and discover a left over food which obviously passed their expiration date from the stench. I called and asked to be move a different room but was told there weren't any available. The walls in the room is very thin, I can hear everything from next door, the fact that the people next to me were extremely loud and woke me up at 5am and in the middle of the night did not helped either. Since i was told earlier the rooms were completely occupied, i did not informed the hotel staff of this nuisance since they won't be able to move us.

Upon check in around 11PM on Friday night, the receptionist asked if we would prefer 2 or 1 beds, of course we said two. When my husband checked in moments later, he was not asked this question and received a King Bed for three people while our room had 2 Queens for 2 people. Of course, we swapped rooms so that no one had to sleep on the floor. The receptions did not really appear too friendly, he handed over our room keys, but did not provide any details whatsoever as to fitness room, pool, breakfast hours, or wireless internet access (the signal kept dropping). Our room with a king bed was a sleep number bed, however it did not work. The bed itself was very comfortable with nice bedding and allowed for two excellent nights sleep.   We appreciated the warning in the shower about the steep sides of the shower as my mother is very short and the area could be very slippery. The room also had a nice size refrigerator for drinks and left over snacks and the carpet looked to be fairly new.

Lastly, they forgot the beer I had ordered; there were only three tables...  - Amenities: Fitness room and swimming room are average and good to have, and fairly clean.  Manager did email me to thank me for feedback, not sure if things have changed now...
 
 
 Room Tip:  Search online for discount code, most of the time there is one to help you save 10% to 15%

The service is decent, the beds are good... but overall the place is dated and tired looking. Carpets in the rooms look dirty, bathroom looks pretty cheap.  The restaurant looks like something from the 70s-80s. Their Caprese salad is yummy but onion soup is disgusting. Their wine list and complementary bar mix is decent. Still, this area has lot's of other restaurants so I suggest going elsewhere....

Booked a room and got confirmation quickly. Called to say we'd be checking in late and they were extremely polite and made a note in our file.  When we arrived, the hotel lobby was really beautiful, luxurious even. The check in staff were again friendly and chatted with our children about their day at Canada's Wonderland. Our sons were then presented with Children's Gift Bags. They were age appropriate to each of them (6 and 2) and they loved them.  We got to our room and were very surprised. It was large and the best were triple sheeted (no awful bedspreads), the rooms temp was great and easily changed, the pillows were to die for. Everything was clean and looked fresh and new. Bathroom, fridge, everything was above expectations for $121 a night. TV was large and phones, hair dryer, iron, tea kettle everything else worked. We got the location, floor and pillow type requested through the site also. There was a coach bus full of teenagers on our floor and we never heard them.  Restaurant staff was friendly helpful and chatty (in a good way). Restaurant is breast-feeding friendly and advertises such on all the entrances. Dinner was very delicious and there was a lot of food. Breakfast was no different. Full hot buffet (eggs, sausage, bacon, hash browns, cereal, bagels, lots of fruit and juice, coffee, milk and a lot more). It was clean and service and was quick and efficient. and its included in your room price.  The pool was very family friendly, there was a small yoga room, sauna and a large hot tub too. My one and only complaint is that you must walk through their beautiful lobby from the pool. There were people checking in while we were returning wet and in out bathing suits...aawwkwward...  Check out was a breeze and we were welcomed back.   I would highly recommend this hotel to families planning a trip to Canada's Wonderland.

The last time I stayed there the breakfast food in their restaurant was very greasy. This time, I stayed there for one night with my eldest daughter who was going to take her entrance exam for Seneca College early the next day. As we were preparing for bed, I smelled cigar smoke around 9 p.m. I called the Front Desk to report the smell as I was staying at a non-smoking floor. They said they would look into it. I checked back & the front desk told me that the manager had looked into it & was having the smell deodorized. After about 30 minutes, I smelled cigar smoke again. I again reported this to the Front Desk & they advised they would have the manager look into it again & would call me back. I was very frustrated at this time & said that because of the inconvenience, I should not have to pay for my room. They offered to move me to another room but I pointed out that it was 10:30 p.m. & my daughter, who already was asleep, had to take an early exam. The Front Desk associate, Christine, advised she would refer it to the Day Manager but they would continue to spray around to deodorize the smell of the cigar. At this point, the smell was everywhere in the room and in the hallway & made it difficult to sleep. Not to mention that all our clothes now had a cigar smell.  I spoke to the Day Manager, Anita Sanchez, the next day and she said that the smell was caused because a hotel guest, who was on the 3rd floor which was a smoking floor, had left their door open so that the cigar smoke entered through the elevator shaft & wafted up into the 14th floor. She also mentioned that I was not the only hotel guest who had complained about the cigar smell. She then informed me that she could not grant my request for a free room but that she would give me a 25% discount on the room & a free upgrade with full breakfast the next time I would stay with them.  If Ms. Sanchez thinks that a 25% discount of $30 is sufficient to cover the cleaning costs in order to remove the cigar smell from our clothes & will placate me, she is very wrong. It was not my problem that the hotel guest chose to leave their door open which then caused the smoke to circulate in the hotel. It is their problem that this incident inconvenienced me & my daughter plus I now have to take care of cleaning the smell of cigar smoke from our clothes.  This will be the very last time we will ever go to this over-priced hotel where the staff don't care about their guests.",1,negative

The breakfast was fine, they had scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, fresh fruit, oatmeal, yogurt, cereal, all the standard things.

When I showed up for the night, they told me that my reservation was for the night before. Worst yet, they billed us for one night as a no show penalty. While there, I spoke to the manager. Instead of apologising for the error he defended their policy of once a confirmation number is given a no show penalty applies. He showed no sensitivity to the customer just parroting the same line.

Like a few other reviews, I have to agree the rooms could use some renovations. They weren't nasty by any stretch, but the TV was ancient and not flat screen. It was even a Magnavox and I don't think that brand has been around for a long time. The beds had controls to pick a sleep number which I was excited to try, but they didn't work on either bed.   The beds though were comfortable and the room was very clean. Most of the staff I encountered were overly friendly and helpful(aside from an older gentleman that worked at night. He wasn't very friendly at all).   The location was ok and fairly easy to get to and out of it. We found several restaurants a ways down the road. The hotel does have an over priced restaurant on site with an equally over priced bar.   As a smoker, I was happy to see a nice outside area where smoking was allowed very near the lounge.

Firstly at the restaurant at dinner on the Saturday we asked for directions to either Mcdonalds or Tim Hortons thinking of breakfast the next morning. The young server got the printed them off for us and highlighted the route for us. The second instance was my friend had some bottles of beer that she thought needed an opener.

The breakfast buffet was very good and at $14 per person a very good deal.   Room was lovely and we will definitely stay there again when in the area.",5,positive

2301526,markham\ca\181720\182906\2301526.html,Delta Markham,"Spent several days at the Radisson in July 2004 when I was in Toronto for business. The service was uneven at the hotel, even though I have always found Canadians to be exceptionally friendly. It was at check in Sunday evening when the desk clerk Diane was checking me in. The service was perfunctionary and the attitude was indifferent at best. I was given room 514. Upon finding my room next to the noisy ice machine, I tried unsuccessfully to open the door. I returned to the check in desk to inquire and someone else helped me while Diane did not even inquire about why I returned or apologized. The other desk clerk then gave me a room on the 16th floor after I complained about the noise and the wrong key.  At breakfast buffet at the Tivoli restaurant (included in the room rate), the service was also uneven with waiters ignoring empty coffee cups or diners seeking tables. The food selection, although not expansive, is very good, including eggs and bacon, etc.  The hotel room itself is quite nice, once I managed to get into a room. It is large and spacious with a comfortable work area and the high speed Internet a great plus. Definitely ask for a room on the 16th floor, a non-smoking floor. The downstairs lobby area and the pool/gym are clean and comfortable, albeit a little drab. The price is reasonable as well. If your business is across the street on Allstate, or near Radisson, the Markham property is a good choice, given the right room. However, we got a chance to visit the Hilton Suites down the road off Hwy 7 and it is much newer and more modern and offers much more aesthetically. For example, it has an open atrium with sweeping stairs. However, the prices reflect the more upscale property.  I gave it an above average rating due to the very comfortable bed and room, but took points away for the so-so service and the tired décor.",4,positive

My room # 915 had sleep # beds that didn't work and they were locked at a hundred which I would say is like sleeping on a curb. Thought after a night of that I would at least hit the hot tub and try to fix my aching body. Nope the hot tub was in dry dock with no water in it. I ate the breakfast buffet in the restaurant there and the meat selections where dry and overcooked. On a positive note my room was clean and appealing and the staff seemed very friendly but not having a good nights sleep kind of put a damper on the weekend and the drive home.
 
 
 Room Tip:  Make sure the bed works before you are really settled in or in my case 11.30 at night.

The hotel was completely booked but we got a decently higher up room as other reviewers suggested. The room we walked into was nice and clean. The first thing we check is the bed and was surprised it was a sleep number bed!! Super excited to try it we played around with the control. The right side of the bed was stuck on number 70 (which was super firm) and the other side worked well. It was cool being able to change the firmness. The bathroom was clean and the shape of the shower was cool although not really fun for taller people. The cleaning staff came around at 9:30ish in the morning and knocked on the door. Make sure you put a sign on the door if you want them to skip your room!  PROS: After reading other reviews we thought we'd get one of those older tvs but I think they may have recently upgraded to a new LED tv (YAY). The room was nice and clean, with a good view out into Markham. The hotel itself is close to many restaurants and not much traffic congestion. FREE WIFI IN THE ROOMS AND FREE PARKING!!!   CONS: The bed was kind of broken but hotel was booked so we dealt with it and notified the hotel staff as we were checking out. As noted again by other reviewers, the thermostat was confusing. There was one on the wall to adjust the temperature but it actually told us to play with the actual heater near the window. We were NOT going to play around with that it was really dusty.   Overall: I would recommend this hotel. It provided a nice and comfortable stay (if you're only planning to stay a night or two). =]

I always go there when I go to Markham! I stayed there for 5 days during Oct 20 to Oct 26 and it was really great!  Only downside is the decoration and also the Tivoli Garden that deceived me this time! The deco is very old and would benefit from a total makeover! It's s great hotel and such a great hotel deserves a very great decoration!  As for the Tivoli Garden, it was not the quality I was expecting. I found that the new menu isn't that great as the last time I went there and prices were also a bit expensive compared to the last time.

Step off the elevator to a guest floor and be transported to a well-used, vintage, 70's style rec room: stained, patterned carpeting ripples down the hallway and emits a very unpleasant musty smell. Guest room decor is hotel chic circa 1978 and smallish bathrooms feel like they have been set-up for the Keebler elves. Best yet is the completely unique (not in a good way) shower/bathtub insert: it actually contains a warning sign that alerts guests that the sloped sides of the tub are dangerous when you enter and exit.   Although room decor was stuck in the past, Delta beds are always super comfortable, linens fresh, spotlessly clean room, and the small microwave and fridge useful. Be sure to ask for a room with a flat screen TV as many of the oldest rooms are still housing box-style sets in a clunky wardrobe. Pricing is super reasonable (we paid $115 for a 'premium' room) and staff should be commended for their positive, ""can-do"" attitudes...we always appreciate their friendly and responsive hospitality. (Staff are the only reason this gets 3 stars, otherwise a solid 2 for room appearance). Although this is an excellent location we wouldn't consider coming back to this Delta until the scheduled remodel is completed. Husband is concerned that this review was too tough and says, ""it's not horrid, I've been in horrid and this is not it."" (Surface parking is free!)

The hotel is conveniently located at Hwy 7 and 404 and near lots of shopping. The rooms are equipped with Sleep Number beds and I was excited to try these. I must say I was a little disappointed in the beds, but as this is the first time I have used one maybe I didn't adjust it properly. We were beat our of the tournament by Sat afternoon and although the whole team had booked two nights the front desk staff let us cancel our second night with no charge which was greatly appreciated by all.

There was also debate among the staff that we brought this up to if this device was adjustable, and were told at one point that it wasn't actually meant to keep items cold,..but when we inquired why it was in the room if it was just a box, they couldn't tell me. They offered at one point to send up maintenance but clearly that didn't happen. Because of the high temps in the room, it caused the ""cooler"" to heat up and we lost everything we put in there due to he high temps. When I brought it up again, we were told that it was only meant to keep drinks cold, not food. What the difference between food and drinks are in staying cold I'm unsure.

Our tour group of about 50 people arrived at slightly past 8pm and within a short while, we have already collected our room cards and proceeded to our respective rooms. Very efficient service. The lobby was spacious, nice and brightly lighted with complimentary newspapers. Also sweets were provided at the reception.  There were 3 lifts (if I remember correctly) and were spacious and fast, unlike the other hotels, with only 2 lifts and were very slow-moving.  We were staying on the 8th storey. Our room was spacious, cosy, nice and clean. It's beautifully decorated and modern. The feeling was comfortable and great. It has everything we need (which some other hotels we stayed in do not provide), from large TV, coffee making machines with sachets of coffee and tea, kettle, fridge, iron and iron board etc.  The toilet was spacious too and has a bathtub and nice too. All the essential toiletry items were well provided for.  The beds were soft and comfortable and we had a great sleep despite the fact that we needed to wake up early in order to catch the cruise touring the Thousands Island (which we did not have breakfast at the hotel and so cannot comment on that). I like sitting on the green sofa, looking out at the windows with greenery.  As for WiFi, it was provided free for guests with login a must. The only issue we had with this hotel was WiFi. The speed was slow and connection was unstable (perhaps too many people were using at the same time) and so our connections were cut off, and remained on and off several times and were quite frustrated about it. Even in the early morning, it was still weak and only around 4-5am, it got stable.  When we checked out the next morning at around 6am, the process was fast and efficient with 2 duty staff manning the counter. They were all smiling and greeting us.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay here at this hotel as it had provided everything essential and were perfect which we need and with a satisfactory service.

I will definitely stay at a Delta again just for the bed alone. I read that there was sleep number beds here but didn't see any indicator of that. I guess I could have inquired but it didn't matter because the bed was awesome anyway! The location is very close to the highway and easy access from the 407 with lots of free parking.

The bed in our room was dreadful. The bed's firmness was controlled by an electronic remote control. Sounds great, right? You get the firmness or softness you want. What could be better when staying away from home? In reality, however, it was like sleeping on a giant balloon. The more you upped the number on the control, the harder the balloon got. This would be fine for me as a like a firm mattress. The problem was the position of the balloon. It wasn't consistently firm. The middle section was much firmer than the rest - and very uncomfortable for sleeping. On the other-hand, the more you decreased the pressure, the flatter it got. At the lower levels it was like sleeping on a deflated water bed strapped over a wooden frame. Just miserable.   After writing this review and reliving the worst sleep I've had a hotel in years I am tempted to again give this place two starts. But the mattress we had could have just been a lemon/one-off. I would have switched rooms had we not arrived late. Everything else about this hotel was just okay. As such, my review stands at a considerate ""average"".

The staff here are always excellent, willing to help out anyway they can.  The lobby looks fantastic as this has obviously been renovated. However, the updates stop there.  The rooms are a tad dated but are functional. In the double queen rooms, it comes with a working desk (big enough for a laptop and some papers) and chair; a loveseat and ottoman, and the TV stand. There is also a nook or coffee area (complete with kettle) where the refrigerator is located. The space is large enough for people have their suitcases along the wall without blocking the space around the beds. All of the furniture and carpeting could use an update as most them are starting to show their age. The TV is a good size and offers a decent assortment of local channels.  Also comes with an A/C unit mounted along the exterior wall. This can be noisy at times especially when the compressor comes on.  Beds are comfortable but are varied between rooms. In Suite 1016, there was a Sleep Number bed, but it seemed to work intermittently. The other rooms were your standard fare.   The bathroom fixtures are pretty standard, and could use some updating. The showers are are a big cumbersome as they have heavily rounded edges, to the point where they leave a note warning you to be wary of said edges. The shower heads provide good pressure but are hard to adjust or re-position.   The rooms are clean and managed well, but again, the age of the building is starting to show.   Lighting in the room is localized to the bed lamps, the stand lamp beside the loveseat, the desk lamp, and the ""hallway"" light just inside the room. I barely turn on the hallway light as it does not do much for the space.   The fitness centre has a universal gym, an elliptical and two treadmills. There is a TV in the corner but is a little high from the closest treadmill. The gym also looks down on the pool, so if one in the family wants to break a sweat while the rest goes for a dip, it's a good solution.   Overall, it's a good location if you're not looking for anything luxurious and just want a functional room with some basic amenities.

Breakfast buffet is good. Good food, friendly service, good variety on the buffet. I had a room on an upper floor, and highly recommend. This is an excellent 3-4 star type of hotel.   I'd stay there again and recommend it to friends. I'd take my family there as a very good place to stay. But usually on vacation we ""live it up"" and get wonderful hotels with good weekend rates.   Watch out - the wireless high speed only goes up so high in the floors, so you may need traditional cable high speed on the upper floors, or just ask for a room on a floor with wireless high speed internet access.    For plain business travel, this suits my needs and price is good. Nice, convenient, friendly. From that perspective it rates an ""excellent"".  Especially for U.S. travelers - convert some money to Canadian and carry cash for the cab drivers that sit outside. The cab I got in didn't take credit cards, and they'll take US cash, but due to currency conversion that makes a ride to the airport very expensive.  Good luck! to all fellow travelers...",5,positive

We checked in quickly, staff was pleasant and very professional.  The room was affordable, it was beautiful, big and spacious with a sitting area separate from the bedroom which was great. They had a ""Sleep Number"" bed which my husband had a field day with. We had a really good night's sleep.  They did not have complimentary breakfast .. But there was a restaurant available next to the main lobby.  Delta Markham is easily accessible from the Don Valley Parkway 404 North and Highway 7. It's close to a lot of restaurants and about a 10 minute drive from Markville Shopping Centre.  Our stay was great, they did have a lot of young adults in the building the night of our stay so I am assuming it's the reason why one of the elevators had a smell of a certain recreational odor in it.   It's probably also worth the mention that I have attended a handful of work conferences at the delta Markham and the conference rooms are great too and the food is also good.

The hotel is clean, check in was speedy and the rate wasn't bad for GTA - $130/nught but it's the little things that make a hotel better than others.  The decor is stuck in the 90's - pickled oak furniture is looking very dated. The TV in my room was a fabulous 27-inch tube model. Cable was out in the entire hotel the first day. There were two phones in the room - a hard wired and a cordless - neither worked. The desk chair was off kilter and hard to sit in as the rocker tension was way too loose and there was no adjustment. The windows were paper thin and I could traffic at all hours.   The king bed had a firmness adjuster but it didn't work on my bed. Thankfully the bed was at the right setting so it wasn't an issue.  The rooms were cleaned daily by a very good staff. The first morning the cleaner organized my toiletries and placed them on a towel for cleanliness purposes. It was a nice touch.

As the service there was beyond my expectations, I figured Radisson had something special going on. Unfortunately that was not true here. Here, I found the staff inattentive, rude and disinterested. While my check in was quick, the room assigned to me was dirty. Upon returning to the Front Desk to let them know of this, I was told I ""must be mistaken"". If a clean room is intended to have bed sheets pulled down to the floor, a room service tray on the desk and yellow water in the toilet, then I was truly mistaken. The desk staff very reluctantly changed my room after about 5 minutes of discussion. Service in the restaurant was a bit better, but no coffee refills were offered. To top matters off, the room rate that my travel agent provided to me on my e-mail confirmation was lower than what the hotel charged me. When I questioned this at check out, I was told that I ""signed for the rate on my check in card and therefore the rate stands"". In the end, they took me for an extra $12.00, which I am happy to say will not make or break me. Unfortunately, I think it would have driven them in to bankruptcy. I will consider the Hilton or Holiday Inn next time I am in the area. From past experience, they know what they are doing.",1,negative

It comes with tickets to Canada’s Wonderland (2 Adults) Ontario Place (2 Adults & 2 Children), Toronto Zoo (2 Adults & 2 Children) or the Science Center (2 Adults & 2 Children) --you choose three of these destinations. Breakfast for the three mornings is also included and the parking is free.  The lobby, while still under construction, was clean and inviting. The staff were very organized and courteous. An envelope detailing our package with directions to the attractions and coupons for our breakfasts was awaiting our arrival upon check-in. My young son was given a little bag with some activities –a nice touch. Checking-in took all of two minutes. Our attraction tickets were available shortly afterwards –only because we hadn’t said beforehand where we were going.  The room itself was a good size and clean. The bedding was all white –not one of those busy bedspreads some place use to hide the stains, and the beds and pillows I found very comfortable. The bathroom was clean, not a speck of mildew or stray hair anywhere. I loved that there was a kettle and a teapot in the room (as well as the standard coffee maker).   The included breakfast was more than your usual continental fare –sausages, bacon, hash browns, eggs, French toast, breads, muffins, pastries, bagels, cereals, fresh fruit, yogurt… The waitresses were very attentive –especially considering it’s a buffet. For a free breakfast I thought it was terrific.  The hotel was a convenient distance from all of the attractions we visited and was close to a variety of restaurants.  The only complaint I have is that the package includes two children’s tickets to Ontario place -these are only good for up to age five, and the breakfast buffet is free for two adults --for children over five there’s a charge. This should be clarified on their website, or the tickets upgraded and breakfast included for the entire family.  We had a wonderful time. We will definitely stay here again.",4,positive

TV was turned on high volume since 6 in the morning. And their loud conversations and slamming continues until they go out. Very annoying.  We had frequently stayed at this hotel for the past few years at least once or twice a year. We were always given complimentary coupons for breakfast for everybody in our party.

When we got to our room after check-in we found it was a King room so we had to trek back to reception to ask for the change once more.

The beds were clean and comfortable. The bathroom was fine too though there was a crack in the sink and the bath/shower unit had an odd shape which required a warning to be posted to take care when entering.

63100184,markham\ca\181720\182906\63100184.html,Delta Markham,"The Delta Markham Hotel is located just off the 404 (at Highway 7, north of 407), a highway directly twenty minutes north of the downtown core of Toronto. From first impressions, I was impressed! The exterior of the building was well kept, and a large parking lot surrounds the premise. The self serve parking lot is hassle free, with plenty of spots, and best of all FREE!  The lobby was missing some tiles, and lacked additional decor to complete its look. This renovation needs to be completed! As the rest of the hotel is good, and the lobby was the only place I could nag about. The front desk is too simple, and just needs some large art work to give you a focal point.  There is a swimming pool and work out gym directly next to the front desk. I had an opportunity to use it one morning, and it worked for what I needed it for; Nothing fancy, but enough to get a good workout. A small convenience store/booth is located in the lobby for any emergency items one may have forgotten.  The three elevators (+ I service elevator) have been recently renovated, and helps keep wait times to an acceptable level. The hallways were average for this quality (3-Star) and what you would expect for the price. You can hear people in the hallway, but it never became an issue on our trip.  Room qualities are standard and met my expectations. I had booked two rooms, and was upgraded to a 1BR suite, with a divided living room which had a small kitchenette. This would be the best options if travelling with children, as it has a room divider, fridge, stove, and microwave. The living room also came with a 2nd television and a pull-out sofa. The standard rooms are – well, standard, and came with a queen size bed. It has a mini fridge but no microwave. These rooms have a typical layout of bathroom, bed with television in front, and a pull-out sofa with desk in front, followed by a window.  Washrooms were clean, and water pressure was not an issue. They use an insert shower which I had my doubts about at first, but turned out to be quite functional. It was quite deep for a bath, and as the girlfriend pointed out, has a lip to sit on when shaving your legs (what do I know?). But it does get tight if you’re taking a regular shower.  Unlimited internet with cable/wireless is available in each room. Televisions provide enough channels to keep you occupied if spending room time. And the restaurant isn’t overly expensive when compared to other experiences.   At the corner of Woodbine is a shopping plaza called First Markham (10 minute walk), which has a series of incredible Asian restaurants to choose from and a Cineplex Odeon. We ate at a restaurant called Congee Wong, and were very impressed: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! $7 for a plate of fried noodles that came lightning fast, delicious, and was big enough for two. Can’t beat that I tell ya!  The Delta’s direct competitor appears to be the Holiday Inn Markham, with the only difference being that Delta has slightly nicer rooms/beds, while the Holiday Inn is one exit closer to Toronto. But depending on why you’re in Markham, the Delta may be the perfect place for you!",4,positive
65201405,markham\ca\181720\182906\65201405.html,Delta Markham,"Honestly one of the best hotel experiences I've had in a long time. Probably THE best. My girlfriend and I stayed here after experiencing HELL from another hotel, The Yorkland Hotel (which should be avoided at all costs. If you read my review for the Yorkland you will understand why). After having a bad experience with the Yorkland, we decided not to say there and went to the Delta Markham. They immediately treated us with great service and a smile. We told them our story and the ordeal we had to go through, which they were very empathetic of. The man we dealt with, I believe his name was Joe, he was VERY helpful and VERY friendly. He spoke to us and gave us advice on how to deal with our problem. On top of all that when we checked in, he upgraded our room to a premium room for the cost of a standard one, simply because we had dealt with so much already and he wanted to show us exceptional service. On TOP of that, he gave us two complimentary passes to their breakfast buffet at their restaurant (which worked out perfectly because we had an early morning the first day). These were all small things he did not have to do, but did them to keep us happy as first time customers; and it worked well. Unfortunately we did not see him again, otherwise I would have thanked him again and recommended him for a raise or something. Seriously though, if any managers for the Delta Markham read this, you should be happy to know your employees are doing their job well to uphold the reputation that Delta Hotels has created for itself. They are actually going above and beyond to keep customers happy. Anyway, back to the actual experience. The hotel itself is beautiful and the amenities are amazing. The location isn't that convenient if you don't have a car (which we didn't), but its not that big a deal. It's right off the highway so its hard to miss. The viva/yrt also bus stop is right in front of their hotel's main road as well, so it is accessible if you don't have a vehicle. There are a few plazas close by with a lotta food places and a few shopping spots (not a whole lot though). There is this really good Thai place close by. Great food, great value; you should check it out if you stay here (can't remember the name though). The whole 3 nights we stayed, exceptionally comfortable and great service (always changing our towels/sheets, bringing new soap and other things we used). They even cleaned twice in one day for us at one point. At the end of the day, we started our weekend horribly, but ended amazing. I definitely will love to return here again and would look forward to spending time there and being served by such professionals. I also recommend this to EVERYONE; couples, families, business trips, whatever. It's a quiet hotel in a nice quiet location. So if you just need a weekend getaway, or whatever it is, it's perfect for all occasions.",5,positive

I do not find the location convenient necessarily but located at the juncture of two highways getting around is not difficult for the traveller who is not interested in staying near tourism spots. Delta Markham has many positives. One is the service one gets from the front desk and the maid service. Nice and polite. Parking is free and easy to access. They are not out to make an extra buck from you for parking on top of the already low prices for the rooms. The weakness of the hotel is first its tired and pointless exercise equipment/pool and the charge for Internet access at their business centre. To log on to the Internet one has to pay extra via a credit card. Seriously? Come on. This should be standard by now. I mention that this is a return visit because last time Internet was free. As internet becomes more standard they have decided to make it unfree.  Other than that, they have this weird harem look going on at the front desk with the decoration looking either like a wedding backdrop or someone's idea of a fantasy bedroom. It is strange but I am nitpicking I suppose. The rooms are nice and the service nicer. Free the internet access and get a real gym going and Delta Markham gets even better.",3,negative

The pool was freezing and small. Thank goodness the hot tub wasn't overly hot and it was a good size for us all to play there. Later that night DH wanted to plug something into a socket located on the desk. It was dead. At midnight - we were all sound asleep - the alarm clock went off! Its a basic hotel with no real perks or frills. Not worth the $115 we were charged. The rooms were small. The beds were lumpy. The shower was small. We were disappointed to say the least.

They have a restaurant which served breakfast and dinner, the food and service was amazing. i have sensitivity for certain food and when i requested for a special meal derek from the restaurant took extra care and made sure that i was getting exactly what i wanted. I had dinner once at the restaurant and called in for Room service the other days.  i did not use much of the hotels facilities but had a look at the pool and fitness center. the location was exactly a place where i would love to stay. there are shops near by and just close to the highway.

Toilet was not secured to floor and our oldest figured out that if you leaned a certain way, it would flush itself. Also, deadbolt would not lock and had to rely solely on regular lock for safety. When you're on the ground floor, by an exit with a door that is also broken, not a safe feeling. By far the worst was the restaurant. To cut it short... no people in bare feet should not be allowed in, 25 minutes is a LONG time to wait for drinks, grilled cheese is not supposed to have mayo cooked into the middle, it does not take an hour to cook kraft dinner, the first meals to come out should have been the kids and PINK chicken is not acceptable to serve to guests.

All of this for less than $100/night. It is very accessible right at 407. The only complaint I have is that some of the AC units don't work well and they make some loud noises. It has happened in two different occasions but the staff acted promptly and changed me to another room and then called to verify that I was comfortable...that is good service...Also, the movie renting service doesn't work most of the times but that is not a big deal to me. The biggest plus is the restaurant, the breakfast is good but the dinner is just really really good...the garlic bread with cheese is like the best I've had in my life.",4,positive

They have been renovating for at least one month now and that normally wouldn't be a problem, given that this would be the best time to do renovations. However, compared to our previous stays, there were several issues at hand because so many things were broken or under repair.  First, the vending machine was out of service. It had a piece of paper saying so, so that was alright. Things break, and I understand that, so it was okay. I wanted to get a pop from the machine across from it though, and it appeared to be in working order. I put money in, only to have it *disappear* and not go down the coin chute. Maybe there is a gap or something...after talking to the receptionist, he promptly gave us a refund, although I was a bit off put that I had to give my name and room number. I was staying for 3 days and like I said, I had stayed there several times. It's a bit insulting to think that someone staying for 3 days would try to rip them off of 3 dollars...as to my knowledge, after I had left, there was no out of order sign placed on the machine either.  The fitness room and the bathroom in the fitness room/swimming pool were also out of order for the duration of our stay. Even the whirlpool had a sign that said out of order, however it seemed to be in perfect working order when I arrived and I was able to use it during my stay.  On the plus side, I needed to send out a fax, which was done for free. I asked the attendant if he could call me when it came back, but I think he misunderstood me. I had to call back to confirm if it had been replied to, to which he did. That was a plus.  Our room seemed to have a knocking sound from the pipes either above or next to us. Perhaps this was because it was unoccupied and cold, or the heater was on too high? Sleeping was more difficult because of this.  The housekeeping staff respected our do not disturb sign, however I cannot grasp why they have to be so loud and chatty early in the morning. Since checkout is 12, some might not want to wake up until later. Sleeping in is hard to do because they are that loud. I would not expect silence but they really need to be conscious of the fact that folks still sleep in in the mornings.  One of the staff there was very courteous and friendly, holding the door for us when we carried heavy items. He was very polite!  Internet speed was average. I can't complain since it is for free (well, I guess it is included in the price of the room) but it does taper off in terms of speed in the evening.  Overall, it was an okay stay. I do not feel we should be charged regular price if so many things are not working/under renovation, but I don't run the hotel...

The rooms are small but they have been freshly renovated and include a fridge and microwave which is great for families.   However on this visit (Feb 22-24/13), the bathroom in the first room we stayed in reeked of stale smoke(243), it was late and kids were already in bed so we changed rooms in the morning after waking with a headache from smoke smell even with the bathroom door closed all night. Then the second night we barely got any sleep due to loud party going on down hall, people constantly walking hallways to and from the room, every other word was the f-bomb (great for our young children to listen to), then we awoke to more yelling at 6am, party still going on, then glass smashing against our door (kids terrified!), then the person walking down hallway smashing more glass, come to find out it was the wall sconces.   What I can't believe is that the management did not attempt to control the noise levels throughout the night, and then also to find out that the people in the room causing the disturbance had NOT been evicted as they were still in the room when we were up at 8am. The hallways reeked of smoke in the morning as well and was worst outside the party room, which also would have been evident if the managment had walked by the room.    Obviously, management lacks control and is unwilling to enforce noise and smoking rules. The ignorance of the disturbance by the management was disturbing. By not enforcing the non-smoking policy is ruining the rooms that have just been renovated, just like the first room we had to move from due to the smoking smell. And to top it off, the managment did not even apologize or anything when we called about the disturbance or checked out.",1,negative

It came with a king bed which seemed comfortable until I woke up the next morning with a horrible stiff/sore next which lasted about 2 days! The pool area needs to be monitored more often as there were old band-aids and wet towels left lying around, does not make relaxing by the pool enjoyable when that is what you have to see. The next morning there was some renovations going on in the main lobby so it is clear to see that the hotel is still receiving some upgrades as they go along. I did not know anything about a breakfast, I was never told by any of the staff as to where that would be or the times it would be available.

Too bad our room did not have the same TLC. The carpet was dirty, and the look was straight out of the 80's. Don't let the photos on the site fool you. Must be some rooms remodeled somewhere. We ventured down to the lower level and the ceilings look straight out of a bad basement remodel, and the door accessing the parking lot was unlocked till 10:30pm. On the bright side, the pool/hot tub/fitness area was very nice, and everyone was very helpful. If we would have had a remodeled room, it would have been much more enjoyable.

The first room they gave us was in a hall where they just cleaned the carpet and the whole hall stuck of chemicals. I called the front desk and they switched the room quickly to another floor.   The second room was ok, wasn't clean properly. They did not clean the coffee maker from the previous visitor and previous visitor did not know how to use the machine, as a result, i spent 30 mins cleaning out the coffee grinds from the water tank. There were dirty towels in the room. Also, I don't know why, part of the hallway smelled like a skunk.. after informing the front desk about this, they immediately compensated me with a complimentary breakfast. They also sprayed the hallway with air freshener and later in the day, they kept all the doors to that hall open to air it out.   It would be nice if they had a towel rack in the bathroom, it was difficult to reuse towels when I don't have a place to hang it and all i can do is throw it onto the floor.   The rubber ducky in the bathroom was a cute addition :)

During our stay, there was a scheduled power outage in the area, and the staff informed all guests with plenty of notices.  The best feature about the Park Inn has to be its super convenient location. It is located right next to Hwy 404 and Hwy 7, with First Markham Place being a 5 min drive away (think lots and LOTS of excellent Asian food). And yet despite the convenient location, rooms throughout the hotel is not noisy at all.  WiFi Internet is free, but unfortunately the connection is rather spotty.

While the room was plain looking, it had all conveniences including a mini fridge, microwave, and coffee/tea maker. It had new pillow top beds and pillows giving us a good night's rest. Little extras included shampoo, conditioner, soap, and rubber ducky in the bathroom and packages of gummy bear treats on the pillows. The pool was very busy when I wanted to use it (several families with kids), and thought I would go back later, but I was just too tired. However I appreciated the fact that it is open until midnight. There is also a hot tub and fitness center. There is the convenience of having a restaurant on site, however the menu has a poor selection and the quality was lacking. I ordered a club house and fries. The club house was served with deli meat, and frozen fries on the side. There is the option of an Asian restaurant down the street if you want something close by.

It's only ""new"" in that is now a Radisson property. Only one wing has had the rooms upgraded. The old rooms are Howard Johnson and much less attractive, although the same comfortable beds and 40"" Samsung TVs are throughout. However, there are not enough pillows for my liking, and no foam extras in the room for those who prefer them.  Nice touches are a fridge with small freezer and microwave. A Longo's grocery store is a short drive away. Standard offerings for this class included are an iron and ironing board and coffee maker (but, come on!... one little sugar packet in the condiments bag??).   Rooms in the ""new"" wing are very nice and spacious while the old rooms are very 1990 and smaller. However, I heard every conversation in the parking lot from my room on the 2nd floor in the ""new"" wing. My room in the old wing was reasonably quiet except for goings-on in the hallway at times.   ""High speed"" wireless Internet is offered for free but is a joke. It did not work well in my ""new"" room or even in the lobby; it topped out at 0.1 MB/second. Welcome to AOL in 1991! OK, no problem, just hook up to the wired system Ethernet, right? Nope. When upgrading the rooms, some management idiot decided to eliminate the wired option. After complaining, I was moved to a room in the old wing where there was still wall ports for Ethernet. Wireless ""worked"" there, but a speed test showed that the upload speed is abysmal even though downloading was OK at 1MB / second, whether wireless or wired. However, without enough upload speed, downloads will stall, and they did all the time for me. In fact, sending signals upstream was so slow (0.09 MB/second wired connection) that even browsing proved problematic. Using Skype for telephone without video was not possible at all. This in inexcusable in 2013. Their service provider ""Pure Pages"" is likely to blame for this poor offering and the upload speed restriction.  Breakfast is not exactly cheap, either: $9.99 for a Hampton Inn style buffet that is free at that chain. The old heater / air conditioner units are simply hot/cold dials with no digital temperature settings, but seem to work OK although are a little noisy.  Travel note: to get to the property, you must use Highway 7 which is a nightmare a lot of the time and especially at rush hour. It's in the middle of an office park and close to a commercial shopping district, so a car is needed to get anywhere. Free parking is a nice bonus for Toronto.

The TVs had many channels and there is a desk as well as a single seat couch and foot rest. The bed seemed a little small for a Queen but the bedding was very clean and comfortable. The washroom was my favourite! It had a shower stall, which I have never seen before. It was the same length as a bath tub so you could walk out from the shower head, which was also detachable. There was a cubby in the wall in the shower for you to put your toiletries and the shower was very clean. The wallpaper was a nice rusty orange with a starburst pattern and the sink was the kind that looks like a giant bowl with really nice water pressure. I think it's called soft pressure water? It was all very clean.  My only beef was that there was not much towel hanging space in the room. There was only a double hook on the washroom door so it's not friendly for people who are squeamish about their towels touching others' towels. Also, the door leading to the back of the building to the parking lot was never locked. It had the sensor for the card keys, but it was kept unlocked for some reason so people would have been able to go in and out of the building as they pleased.  Otherwise this place is very nice. I didn't have to deal with staff at all other than at check in and check out and those times they were nice to me. The hotel is very close to East Beaver Creek which has a lot of restaurants, and it's not even a 15min drive to the nearest Walmart and I believe that there is also a SmartCentre somewhere close by as well. It kind of looks like a motel from the outside but it's nice and modern on the inside. There is also ample FREE parking :)  This was a great first stay and I look forward to staying here again next time :)

The bed was comfortable and the washroom was modern and clean. The TV in the room only went up to channel 30, this wasn't an issue for me however since I was going out for the night.  Here is the ugly. After a long grueling work week if you are looking forward to sleeping in think twice.  Starting at about 6am the housekeeper in the hallways of the 200 rooms was literally screaming! Screaming, singing and vacuuming could be heard starting from 6am to check out. She would be yelling outside my door to other employees it was the most irritating annoying occurrence I have ever experienced in a hotel. No respect for the guests what so ever as she continued to yell at other employees down hallways throughout the morning. Someone train this lady to have respect in the early hours.

190336066,markham\ca\181720\188174\190336066.html,Park Inn By Radisson Toronto-Markham,"Stayed a single night. We were originally offered a room in the newly updated section of the hotel (the hotel has switched brands and some rooms still have not been renovated) and then a room in the un-renovated section. The hotel's location is right next to the highway, but far enough and insulated enough that we heard no noise. The parking lot seemed small and being winter, wasn't optimal for getting in and out quickly. (Let's face it, it's cold out there!)  The newly renovated section is quite nice. Colours are muted. Decor is modern and relaxed. Service at the reception was professional. Room was clean. (We only saw the room, we then backed out, realizing the error and went to talk to reception again.)  The older section is quite garish, especially the rug and some of the wallpaper. The decor was dated but in good shape and the room was clean. The wifi signal wasn't great, but likely because we were in one of the most remote rooms. Still the room was quite nice, the bed was better than others, TV worked fine, bathroom was clean and included a rubber ducky!  Checkout was quick and professional. The location meant that you had to drive out a bit further for everything, but still fine. What's with the Toronto Sun? Couldn't get a real newspaper? Oh and incidentally in Canada... Business Centre and for the restaurant, entrée is an appetizer, not a main course, from the French word... to enter!

It is not new at all, but it seems to have been taken over by the Park Inn group who are in the middle of revamping it. The website says it has an Olympic sized pool...which it does not! The pool is okay, but not huge, it was clean though. The hot tub was way too warm for actual use and the sauna would not turn on when we tried it. The rooms were very dusty, but okay, however, you can hear everything from the hall and other rooms. On our second night we were disturbed from around 11pm-3am. Someone in the room next to us wouldn't let their partner into the room. They were banging on the door for ages trying to get the other person inside to open the door. The guy trying to get in then slept on the floor in the hall for a while. Then someone from the hotel arrived and the banging on the door started all over again. Then when the guy did get in there was arguing and people falling against the wall. Twice the bang to the wall was enough to move my husband's head on our headboard. Its funny because earlier in the day they were getting on very well as my husband had the misfortune of listening to them 'getting along very well' whilst he was trying to read and relax. We told the staff about all of this whilst checking out, but were only offered a reluctant apology. Overall, this hotel did the job of giving us somewhere to stay for a reasonable price whilst we were unable to travel due to bad weather, but this wasn't the Park Inn hotel that I had expected after staying in several of their sites in Europe.",3,negative

The beds are a little too soft in the middle anyways to share. The bathroom is very nice, but also very very small. There is almost no counter space to put things, and no towel bars. Some rooms have a highway view, so don't get those. That said, the rooms are nicely equipped with microwave, mini fridge, quietest old motel style AC unit ever made, and a power bar on the side of the desk.  My only gripe are the towels. O.M.G. are they hard. I have had chips less crunchy than those. The pool towels are actually passable, if your towel is too hard, grab one of those and take it to the room.   PS. The little yellow duck in the photos is actually provided in the room. It's a cute touch, but my room only had a stand up shower... Illogical duck is cute, but still illogical. :)

The man at the desk was very quick to upgrade me to a nicer room. The staff were always very nice to me and more than willing to help. I found my new room much brighter ,nicer. The only other complaint I have is the towels/linens were rough probably due to the bleaching process. Carpet in room was clean,but stained. Cobwebs in corner of ceiling. The staff try really hard to please their guests. I did eat breakfast in the empty restaurant and found it quite nice. The waitress there was also very friendly. I think if the hotel spent more money on keeping the place comfortable they would get return guests,but personally I prefer my towels/linens a little softer and prefer not to see dust in corners.The hotel was the best price around and the staff were wonderful.

I got this property as an Express Deal booked through Hotwire. Though there was no need. The difference between the Hotwire price and the web rate for the property was $12! Not worth the bother of Hotwire. I read through the reviews of TA and was slightly concerned but I called the hotel and requested a renovated room. The hotel clerk (nice girl) noted the change and indicated that all rooms with two beds were renovated. The room was clean and nicely decorated with a beautiful bathroom. The only negative is there is limited counter space and the lighting isn't quite dim. I had to put my makeup on in the hallway (mirrored closet doors - but not the tacky 70's kind!)  We did not use the pool so I am unable to comment on it. There is a restaurant adjacent to the hotel but we didn't take advantage of that either.

Staff were friendly, room was updated with two double beds, TV, and microwave. Hotel has a decent sized pool and a small hot tub and Sauna. Found some Ants in the Pool area ( strange) and often we found that they couldn't keep up with that e towel demands.  Interesting fact: The pool holds swimming lessons on Sunday for the entire day. This makes a huge impact into the guests being able to use the pool. Guests are confined to an area the size of a single swimming lane, which you must stay in. That was frustrating. The staff we're indifferent to our conversation around how we felt about this matter. They apologized, but honestly didn't care. I'm sure they've heard about that many times, and the back door has no lock, or doesn't work as we didn't need our key to get into the building at anytime of the day. Hotel also has a small little snack bar to purchase items as a corner store is a bit of a far walk. Would stay here again for sure as the price was very reasonable.

Restaurants abound and there is lots of shopping close by including the Fairview mall which is about 15 minutes away. Ultimately, the value was excellent and I think this is a drawing card as the parking lot was full every night. They also have a full service restaurant which I did not try but did check the menu which was simple and offered a reasonable selection of dishes other than the proverbial burger.

The exterior does look outdated but the interior isn't too bad looking. We picked this hotel for the pool, hot tub and sauna. The room was a King bed, newly renovated suite located on the first floor near the entrance. (not a good place to have your room) We went to our room and found it very nice. The bathroom had a nice glass shower. The shower had more room than the washroom area. Satisfied with the room. Clean and smelled fresh. We went to the pool area where there were about 4 other people enjoying the pool. After swimming for about 20mins a large group of boys (15 aged around 16yrs old) came into the pool area. Looked like a sport team of some sort. They began to jump into the pool, shove and push one another making it very hard to enjoy the pool area. the little kids that were in the pool had to get out for fear of being hurt. We also left the pool due to one of the boys spitting constantly into the pool and on the deck area. We then went into the hot tub where we could also not enjoy that due to the big splashes of water being thrown our way. So we decided to use the sauna. After entering the sauna I looked out the window on the sauna door only to see the same boy spitting in the pool and another boy came along and threw our clothes and things on the ground so he could sit down. I went out the sauna door and asked the kid what he was doing and to get up from the chair. At no time were there any coaches or supervisors for these boys. We decided to leave the pool area all together and report to the front desk people. After telling them what happened, the girl working said she would get someone to check it out. She didn't seem to want to help too much. On our way back to our room, there were two females sitting in the hall beside our room on the floor with a laptop and drinks. Didn't they have a room to go to? So after getting dressed I went back out to complain again about the pool and now the hallway hobo's. The hotel staff finally emailed the manager and told him what was happening. We were given a complimentary stay for the night. Went back to my room and the girls were gone and now were outside our room window smoking and talking loud. Overall the hotel was nice and the breakfast was very good. Would stay there another night when there won't be any sports teams staying there.

We had zero complaint with our room, it was clean and decorated nicely, however there were other issues with the restaurant and the swimming pool.  The in house restaurant was terrible. There were three of us and we all received our food and three separate times. My 5 year old daughters ""kids burger platter"" was larger than our meals and the hamburger patty was literately all butchered up and partly in chunks. When she lifted it off her plate a hug chunk fell to the floor with led us to investigate and found that when you lifted the patty it looked like swiss cheese...giant holes through out it and all mangled.   Her replacement burger was a regular patty, however looking at it you cant help but assume the patty was DEEP FRIED........Why would you do that? ridiculous.  We paid and left unsatisfied and if we hadn't of consumed alcohol we would have ventured out for more food immediately. We let the front desk know and they notified the restaurant and they gave us a 5 dollar off coupon for another restaurant in the area......So go spend another 100 bucks on dinner and you get 5 bucks off!! we let the front desk know that we found that Insulating...When we checked out the next morning there was a letter stating if we return to the hotel we can get 15$ off on the next meal at the restaurant...We said but we would never eat there again all we want is my 5 year olds 6 dollar meal comped...the hotel manager came out and was extremely helpful and explained that though the restaurant is here its ran separately from the hotel, he instead of just taking off our daughters meal applied the whole 15 dollars off for ""next time"" off the current bill. Which we felt was quite fair.  Our last issue was that the swimming pool is used for SWIMMING LESSONS from 4-8pm!!!!!! This was my daughters first hotel trip and was quite sad about this and we found it quite annoying. We were not informed of this prior nor at check in and might not have chose this hotel is we had known. There is a small lane reserved for guests during this time, but its impossible to enjoy any time there during the 4hour lessons.... Very unfortunate.",2,negative

In reality its an old hotel that has had its lobby updated and perhaps a few rooms. The website shows a photo of a nice bedroom, but didnt look anything like either of our rooms. I say ""either of our rooms"" because yes we tried 2. The first smelt so musty we asked to be switched, which the friendly staff did. The 2nd room was ok, no smells and the beds looked nice (but not like the photos)  I feel totally misled by the false advertising.  Other issues - The TV is a nice new LCD (as advertised on the website) but it only gets BASIC cable. I havent stayed in a hotel with basic cable in so long I'd forgotten hotels used to do that. So no high def channels (LCD does not mean high def) - just basic low-def cable.  The other big issue is the air conditioning. The unit is ancient - looks to be at least 20 years old and did not work properly. The thermostat knob was extremely stiff and not working. It basically either stays on at full cold or room fan only - had to get up in the middle of the night to switch it as it was getting too cold.   Overall not happy to have been misled about this being a ""new"" hotel. Definately not new - furniture is tired and chipped, hallways are drab and smell like they haven't had ventilation in years.  This would be okay if it was billed as an old hotel that has had a few upgrades, although I think it should be cheaper - more in the $70 range.   Oh and one last thing - we were denied free breakfast because we booked 2 nights before our stay. Had we booked more than 3 nights before we came we would have gotten free breakfast. That's just annoying.

Even after I complained to the manager the room was still filthy that afternoon. Plus the supplies were left in the room. The rooms are run down as is the hotel. If there are new rooms I don't know where they are. The carpets in the hotel are so filthy I'm afraid to think of what's in there.The staff tried to be accommodating. We were traveling with a 3 year old and I was afraid for him to touch anything. My daughter left her Pandora bracelet on the bed. I remember seeing it there not aware she hadn't taken it. Tried to tell the front desk but she didn't pass it along. So the next day we reported it again. They have told us that they have looked everywhere as have we, but we know that it is gone.

We are somewhat frequent visitors to Markham/GTA and the last time we visited was two months previously. We have stayed at the Courtyard Marriott, Residence Inn by Marriott, Old Holiday Inn on Woodbine, Staybridge Suites, and the Delta Markham. This was one of the more disappointing stays we have experienced in a while. As we usually do, we booked our hotel through priceline at a reduced rate a few days before we left. When we found out we got the Park Inn we were pretty excited because the photographs online looked really nice.   Please let me just say that our room looked NOTHING like the photos. We arrived around 2 AM on Thursday evening/Friday morning and our room was on the 2nd floor (really the same floor as the lobby). The hotel receptionist was very friendly and our check in was quick. After turning down the corridor, we entered a much older and more outdated corridor that had a musty smell (this is a theme here). Our room reminded me more of a motel than anything else. It always had a damp feeling, even though we kept on the fan and air conditioner to try and eliminate it. In addition to the worn looking furniture, the carpet also looked like it was well worn and ready for a replacement!   The pool area looked well kept and there were two treadmills and ellipticals in the exercise room. It seemed that only the air conditioner unit on the far wall was working, but I was not sure if I just couldn't figure out how to use it. The exercise room also had cold water in it, which is a great plus for someone that may not have a bottle.   Other positives of this hotel are the reliable internet connection and the refrigerator(smelled funky inside, but kept the waters cold) and microwave. We also went out to eat quite a few times, it was nice to have a place to put leftovers!   Overall, the real disappointment for us is that the rooms are nothing like advertised! We have stayed in quite a few hotels (8 of them this year) and understand that the photographs are never exactly as pictured, but this was quite far fetched. If we receive this hotel when we bid on priceline in the future, we would certainly bear it because the price cannot be beaten, but we will cross our fingers for another hotel in Markham!",3,negative

This hotel was only about an hour away so we decided to try it. It is near Hwy 404/407, easy to get to except for construction on Hwy 7. We booked a ""spacious junior suite"" for a few dollars more than a standard room. The room was great but noisy with window open (too near highway). Room was clean and bed very comfortable. TVs (2) only had 25 channels available despite TV guide showing many more. It appears they only subscribe to ""basic"" cable which was very disappointing. In-room coffee was available along with fridge & microwave. Only problem is no ""real"" cream or milk, only powdered white stuff. For what we paid, I would have expected at least a continental breakfast. There is a restaurant attached but we did not try it.",4,positive

Not all rooms have been updated yet but they are working on it! We were given a 2 queen room that was not updated but it was clean and the beds were comfy. The room was spacious for our family of four. The kids really liked the rubber ducky in the bathtub, nice touch! The bathroom could use more hooks or a bigger towel bar. The air conditioner was one of the best I've ever used in a hotel, cooled without annoyingly cutting on and off. One night we just set it to 'fan' and opened our small window and it was quiet even though this location is near major highways. There was a mini fridge, very small microwave, and single serve (per cup) coffee/tea maker (not Keurig or name brand). The room rate was very cheap so we weren't expecting much but it would still be nice to have the option of stoneware/china coffee mugs as well as the disposables provided.The swimming pool was clean with towels available and deck chairs for lounging. We stayed here to visit the Toronto Zoo (25 minutes away) and would certainly consider it again when visiting family in the area! Next time we will try the newly renovated rooms.:-)

222495696,markham\ca\181720\188174\222495696.html,Park Inn By Radisson Toronto-Markham,This hotel is pretty good value. We stayed two nights and each day drove into Toronto. The drive takes around 30 - 40 mins and even with parking fees it is cheaper than staying in Toronto. Only issue is that a section of the 2 lane highway has an additional 3 lanes of traffic merging within about 200m and at any time of the day it slows traffic speed dramatically. This was a bit painful but even during peak hour it is a relatively small price to pay for a couple of days. The hotel breakfast buffet was missing cereal and fruit and so it is cheaper to order from the menu if bacon and eggs is all you want sans pancakes and sausage. The room is ok and included fridge and microwave. Nearby is a large variety of restaurants. The pool and gym were pretty good too. All up if you do not mind driving to Toronto this is a good place to stay.,3,negative

Wrong! The hotel that was Radisson (I think) is now Hilton suites and this was an old, old motel in an industrial area. Initially, we got a terrible room in the lower level that had a skunk smell, had a super loud air conditioner, with broken furniture, and worst of all drunks FIGHTING in the hallway. The next night we moved to the upper level (through the help of the reasonably accommodating desk staff), which was worlds better, although there was police activity again on the property that night (not the hotel's fault, but still maybe an indication that we weren't staying at the best place). Room was big and had lots of cable channels and fitness room was decent. Pool looked fine. Parking lot filled fast and parking on the rear side seemed sketchy (again, see police activity above). Breakfast was not included. Free wi-fi didn't exactly work flawlessly. For nominally more, I could have stayed at the beautiful Hilton Suites it turns out, so I would say there is no reason to stay here unless it's all that's available.

They fixed that next day. Fan in bathroom never worked despite daily calls. They possibly attempted to fix this but left all the wire clippings on the carpet. The smell of cigarettes and booze in the hallway was overwhelming. They told us they couldn't do anything about it unless they catch people red handed smoking. The room had stains on the lamp shades, carpets etc. The one positive was they were very helpful and prompt contacting expedia where I received half my money back

He was kind and definitely committed to putting guests first, as he was quick at checking us in, and made sure our specific needs were met. The room we received was truly quality and comfort, the cleanliness was unmatched by any place we have stayed at including five star rated resorts! The added little touches of several tea and coffee types on offer, flowers in the bathroom even a cute Park Inn rubber duck truly made you feel at home! In addition a mini fridge and microwave in the room at no extra cost was truly welcome!

227715583,markham\ca\181720\188174\227715583.html,Park Inn By Radisson Toronto-Markham,"This hotel by Radisson appears to have been completely renovated within the last year or two. The lobby is inviting and the Staff very gracious.  The rooms are upgraded as well. Only showers in the rooms -probably people don't take baths in hotels anyway - but, no towel racks.  The meeting room we were assigned to was the Champagne room. This was to be the meeting room, dining room, etc. We descended the stairs (yes, there's an elevator - but, when you know you're going to sit a long time, you walk as much as possible in between).  We enter the lower level - straight ahead was a short hallway and access to the pool, but, directly in front of us and all over the hallway between the stairs and the Champagne room were housekeeping carts. The hotel laundry was to the left going down this hall, on the right was a guest laundry room, then a meeting room, and then, down a short ramp to the Champagne room. Now, you can upgrade a hotel as much as you want, but, if people have to walk through the workings of hotel to get to there meeting room, it is a bad presentation.  The Champagne room was a misnomer by the way. It more accurately reminds me of near beer. The promise of something and none of the expectation.  Upon entering this room, we had to pay for our dinner right away - $30. We had our dinner in this room but the room had been set up in such a way as that the staff had to go all the way through the room, weaving around people who were there for the cocktail hour, to the far side to bring in the buffet. That should have given me some indication as to what was to follow.  Dinner, shall I say, was not worth $30 - Wedge potatoes, without spices, steamed veggies, without spices, thinly sliced medium rare beef in a mushroom au jus (looked promising), chicken (which I didn't have, so, can't comment), rolls and finally pasta salad.  Nothing was hot - surprising, since it was just put out, but, more than that it was bland and you could barely cut the beef with a butter knife (I don't think a steak knife would have helped either). I would like to say that breakfast was better - it was not. Again, nothing was hot. By lunch, I had no expectations of being wowed by anything and wasn't wrong.  This is a nice looking hotel, that appears to have put all of their resources into the look and not the 'meat and potatoes'. Their staff though are very accommodating and pleasant. The only problem I could see with their work was that there were glasses and a cup piled on the floor outside a room when we arrived on Friday (about 3 pm). By the same time on Saturday, they were still there and had been joined all along the corridor by other glassware, plates, etc. For some reason everyone would walk by them - room staff, maintenance, etc., and no one thought to pick them up and remove the risk of someone not seeing them and possibly causing bodily injury due to a trip and fall. We finally went to the front desk to report this risk management area and they had someone go and pick them up.  All in all, if you're not planning to eat here, it's a good hotel and the price was reasonable.",3,negative

I was happy to hear that they were cleaning it. The only negative aspect was the slow service in the restaurant/bar. In the morning it took over 10 minutes for the waiter to bring us our breakfast menus and we sat around for about 15 minutes with empty plates before he came back to clean up and see how we were doing. The food was pretty good though, both breakfast and dinner. Overall I would recommend this hotel.",4,positive

The room was clean and very quiet. We could hear in the hallway that the room next to us was loud but when we were in our room we could barely hear a thing. The pool and hot tub was very quiet. It was relaxing. The bed was comfortable and the room was nicely decorated. Make sure you request newly renovated rooms otherwise you may not be happy. The biggest change from our last stay a year ago was the food. We had breakfast which was great value. Portions were big, food was hot and the service very friendly. They definitely made improvements! In summary if you want a decent hotel for a good price this is a great place. We use it just to have a date night to get away from home for a weekend.
 
 
 Room Tip:  Ask for the newly renovated rooms! If not you will be disappointed.

Wasn't too happy about the fire alarm going off at 6:30 and then again around 7. Especially since we stayed there after a late night at a wedding. Had two vochures for breakfast went to go and the restaurant was closed because it had no heat. (was closed for the rest of the day). Also had a vochure for a free appetizers with lunch. So we couldn't use either of them. They did refund us $20 for the breakfast... I suggest bringing your own snacks though vending area is ridiculously expensive. Had to crank up the heat as there was a draft by the window. Also it would be very easy for rodents to get in (luckily didn't see any). but the back entrance to get out and in you can see right under the door when its shut and snow was actually coming under the door a bit.

I think this place is a great place today first off because of the value. Every time I book it online I get a good rate.   The staff is wonderful, I recently stayed here on the weekend and they were more than accommodating. They answered the questions I had and answered questions I would have asked.   The rooms are very clean and tidy. They have fresh beds and a brand new TV. Everything you need is right there. The hotel only has 2 floors which is nice as well. You don't need to wait forever for an elevator.   The location isn't the greatest as it is on a street that really doesn't have anything. You can drive somewhere in 5 minutes but sometimes that isn't convenient. I believe the hotel does recognize this though as they have a nice little store part with prices that aren't great but not bad either.   The hotel has a pool which is pretty nice! Indoor and great if you have kids and they want to take a swim.   The food was a little disappointing. It is always nice to start your day with a free breakfast and that isn't included. There is a restaurant there but it wasn't the greatest.   One little added bonus is that they have the Toronto Sun for free in the lobby. I love getting the paper in the morning.   Overall for what I want this is a great choice and I will stay a few more times. My only recommendation is that you find a place somewhere a few minute drive away to grab some food.

A good deal at that price but hotel does not meet expectations of a 3.5 Stars. Usually, we stay at the Delta down the street (rated 3 stars) and in my opinion a much better option. This hotel was recently converted from a Howard Johnson and is located within a commercial business area with nothing within walking distance for tourist.  The walls are thin and the lower price is attractive to many families. Although we travel with children, we are respectful and don't let our kids run up and down hallways disturbing other guest. A group of 6 kids played floor hockey outside our door for an hour. Note to parents; the hallway is not your children's place to play cause you're tired of them in the room with you.  Swimming pool is in good condition and the hotel lobby is nice. Free parking and good speed WiFi is a bonus for any traveler. The hotel needs attention and better management. We came downstairs for breakfast over the weekend and saw 5 tables uncleared, another 5 tables with no menus yet, and everyone else waiting for food. The guest just gave us ""the look"" so we drive 5 minutes to Egg Smart (155 E Beaver Creek Rd) which was a much better option.  Rooms are nothing special but clean enough for us. Beds were soft and A/C worked fine, although can be noisy. Bathrooms could use renovating but did the job and water was hot. TV had plenty of channels but $17 for On Demand movies is simply outrageous. We could not hear the highway from our room given how close it was. Microwave and fridge is a bonus!  The location can be overlooked if management improves on the restaurant and keeps children within their rooms or supervised in common areas with their parents. Since this is a commercial area, there's nothing really for kids to do, so perhaps build a play structure in a back corner. This hotel should be rated no more than 3 stars.",2,negative

First off, most sites rate this as a 3.5 star hotel, but I would say that rating is fairly inaccurate and this hotel is more like a 2 star. It meets basic needs, and is best considered a value hotel. We stayed in a king suite, which was definitely roomy enough to accommodate our family of 5. We are thankful that we were upgraded to this room as we were originally offered a king room, which would not have sufficient. I am not certain whether it was Hotwire or Park Inn that messed up our reservation (I am certain I had requested a room that would accommodate 5), but I am glad it was rectified quickly and I give praise to the staff for sorting it out. The hotel itself is definitely a bit dated, and both the room and public areas could stand an update. Our room had a faint damp stench - while not overpowering, it wasn't the most pleasant either. And although we stayed in a non-smoking room, there was also a faint smell of cigarette smoke, and there were definitely patrons nearby that were smoking in their rooms through the night. The indoor pool, much like the rest of the hotel, could stand an update. The pool floor had visible damage. Though I must say they kept the pool at a very comfortable temperature. Overall, it wasn't a terrible stay and probably fitting of the price we paid. But I would not recommend staying here given the other hotel choices in the area.",3,negative

Last year this entire hotel was a breath of fresh air and amazing without question, this year however it is apparent things have gone downhill somewhat. The room itself had spots on the ceiling, furniture in need of paint and TLC, and pillows that were far too soft leading to neck aches. The bathroom while nice seems to have very low water pressure at the sink, and the shower lacks any kind of shower bar, or anti slip material on the floor tiles leading to a concerning shower for anyone with a balance issue. We had an issue with our A/C which meant that the room became VERY hot extremely fast, and as maintenance wasn't in till about 9:30am we had a rather restless sleep. Adding to the A/C problem there were also extremely noisy guests outside in the parking lot past 1:30am and when we called down it seemed like the desk knew exactly where to find them. Hopefully that is not an ongoing problem as it certainly took away from any serenity we had been enjoying. On the whole the staff are still very friendly especially the housekeeper who rescued us in the hallway when we arrived, by showing us that our room door needed to have the door handle lifted up instead of pushed down as you swiped the room key. She was very pleasant throughout our stay! Also a great thank you to the house keeper who came up to ensure we had enough bedding! The desk staff also made us feel very welcomed and were always wearing a smile. It is a shame the hotel itself isn't at the same standard as those working in it, hopefully things improve and the Park Inn is restored to past glory.

It was in a lower floor. Upon exiting the elevator, there was a strong smell of cigarette smoke, even though the hotel is smoke free.  We made our way to the room where the smoke smell was still present there as well as a moldy/mildew smell.  We asked to move rooms which after a little coaxing they agreed to. We were moved to 313.  When we arrived in 313 we noticed the room was extremely crammed in with a chair and ottoman stuck between the bed and window. Upon further inspection, the bathroom was filthy.  The tile flooring was full of dirt, grime and hair. The caulking and surrounding had mold and was stained.  The wallpaper was peeling off the walls, there were drip marks all over the walls, not only in the bathroom and around the room, where the walls met the floor there were cob webs and such.

I returned to the room where my wife, toddler and baby were waiting because we wanted to move rooms.  I decided to call Hotwire. The rep transferred me to a different department. I waited 25 minutes on hold and finally decided that it was too late at night and we had to put the kids to sleep.  Our night was terrible. The hotel was disgusting.

312443205,markham\ca\181720\188174\312443205.html,Park Inn By Radisson Toronto-Markham,"We found this great little hotel through Priceline for less than $90 total. It had everything we needed - friendly staff, fitness center, indoor pool, restaurant, in-room internet and refrigerator for no extra charge, and more in this well-maintained, recently updated hotel with a great bathroom and shower. Would definitely recommend it, especially if you get a discounted price. The only negative was that there wasn't a lot of space in the bathroom to put out toiletries for more than one person.
 
 
 Room Tip:  Queen size bed with sofa option is perfect for 2 people.

312482311,markham\ca\181720\188174\312482311.html,Park Inn By Radisson Toronto-Markham,"First thing that I can say about this hotel is that unless you have a car, there is absolutely nothing in walking distance from this property. This is perhaps the main reason that I would not book here again. A taxi ride anywhere is expensive (and far). I stayed here because of the excellent price per room.  The hotel lobby is simple but the staff is friendly enough. Most staff would say hello to me when I walked around the hotel. It is small but clean and easy to navigate the hotel.  The rooms themselves are uneven. My room was fine (clean and well appointed) and seemed to have been newly refurbished but my companion's room was dingy and old (and definitely could have used some work). You may want to ask for a newly refurbished room. The wifi, tv and conveniences in the rooms (including microwave over and fridge) worked perfectly.  The hotel property was showing signs of aging and could probably be cleaned up and refurbished to be fair, it was fairly good.  The restaurant on site was ok (breakfast was good and not expensive at all) but the service was either really good or really bad depending on the day (we stayed 3 days). For the budget minded, you can eat here fairly well and it will not hurt your budget.  The hotel pool was what you would expect from a hotel such as this. A ciment rectangle with so-so surroundings and an over chlorinated pool. It is ok for a brief swim but given the echos of screaming kids, one would not stay there very long. The hours are very accomodating though (6 AM to midnight). If you can't sleep it is a nice way to help you relax.  The sleep quality ... Excellent! Beds are very comfy and the hotel itself was very quiet at night during our stay.  Overall, it was ok (price was excellent) but not a tourist experience, more of a place to stay for the budget minded.",3,negative

314567944,markham\ca\181720\188174\314567944.html,Park Inn By Radisson Toronto-Markham,"Since I was flying out of Toronto’s Pearson Airport, I found this hotel by filtering my search for hotels with an airport shuttle. Unfortunately for me, I never checked the actual proximity to the airport, which turned out to be forty minutes away. The hotel itself seemed to have has a recent makeover, but still had the feel of an old, tired hotel. The front desk clerk was slow and disinterested. Arriving late at night, after a long drive, the only thing I really wanted was to get into my room and get to bed. So, hiking up to the forth floor to discover that neither of the room keys worked (due to multiple reuses) was particularly frustrating. Then to be woken up in the middle of the night by screaming guest down the hall just made matters worse. I understand that the hotel cannot be held responsible for the guests, however, I do think it speaks to the clientele this place attracts. Next time I will research more and stay somewhere else.

There is one (yes one!) mechanical elevator which appear to function at the speed of the 60s. It would have been much faster walking up the stairs.  Room-wise, the room is pleasant and well taken care of. They have a full length standing shower (no tubs!) and the bathroom is fully provision with decent toiletries. You have the usual 40"" flat screen TV, study desk , ironing board, refrigerator and a cushion chair. Got some fresh fruits and place in the refrigerator and turn it on ... an viola you have started a "" hummingbird"" in the room. That was not as bad till one start the a/c fan to ventilate the room ... was a bit too warm. This started off a ""truck"" in the room. Same goes for the ventilation fan in the bathroom.Then the walls are ""paper thin"" ... I can hear conversation from the neighboring rooms and that from the corridor.

I recently learned that in the Hotel business, many chambermaids are paid per room and therefore when they find stuff left behind they keep it to supplement their income. Needless to say, when the Park Inn called me back to say they have my toiletries in their Lost and Found, I was quite happy. Especially after the very same thing happening to me at the Quality Inn in Barrie and having them tell me...they found nothing. You might ask what my problem is with leaving stuff in the shower stall......;)

Let me say that the stay was quite nice. The beds and bedding were good and cozy, the room clean and the staff professional and helpful.   That said, I raise one issue, and not with the hotel, but with the travel websites which promoted this hotel as 3.5*. As good as this hotel is, it misses that mark for a Toronto area hotel. (I see hotel grading as relative to location. The 3* rated Flamingo in Las Vegas would been rated much higher were it located in most other cities. By local standards.) This Radisson provides comfort and quality service but I must agree with Ringo L in his review that it is a very well run 2*.   I would urge those who manage travel websites to be a bit more resistant to the urge to grade inflation. It only hurts them in the end in consumer confidence in their assessment is shaken.",3,negative

We had a voucher for breakfast - thought can they really mess up breakfast...YES they can!

The male front desk clerk with whom I directly spoke over phone in making this adjustment (I had up until 5 pm day of check-in free cancellation privileges with my Priceline.com booking) tried to snow me three different ways with a suddenly $20 higher charge for the one remaining night (16 Feb/16) citing 'two day minimum stay' and other attempts at false conditions to justify the higher charge. I held my ground and told him there were no such conditions. He relented and gave me the one night at the charge of $54 USD/71 and change CDN.

Everything was clean and comfortable. The staff were friendly, including the cleaning crew. There is no breakfast there, but there are restaurants a few blocks away. There is a restaurant at the hotel, but we didn't try it. I wouldn't advise staying here if you aren't driving, as none of the restaurants are within a short walk. The location is close to two major highways, providing easy access to Toronto and other cities. We drove to the last subway stop at a shopping mall and parked there (for free!) to take an easy subway ride into Toronto itself. There are several interesting Asian supermarkets, malls, and bazaars within five or ten minutes' drive. The only change I would make is that the stripes on the parking lot really needed to be repainted, and the lot itself probably needs re-paving in another year or two. The price I got was quite reasonable for a major metropolitan area.

Now for the overall assessment. How in the world is this a 3 1/2 star rated facility? Who is rating this? This place is at best a 2 star hotel. The place looks old and the upkeep is very poor. The stairways to the pool area is rusty (how many 3 1/2 stars hotel have rust?) when was the last time they were painted or even cleaned? The layout, hall ways and decor does not warrant anything above 2 stars. The hallways are narrow and very low ceilings. Lighting is poor and it's like waking through a maze to get to your room. The outside of the building looks like a government housing project not a fine hotel. The parking lot and sidewalks are in poor shape, although they are renovating the back parking lot. Of course this is very loud and comes through the paper thin walls and windows. You can hear conversation outside your room from both inside and outside. I have stayed in better kept Days inns before. Again how is this place a 3 1/2 star hotel? I stayed at both the Hilton garden inn (3 stars) and the Hampton inn(2 stars) in the area and both of those hotels are far far superior to this place. Very disappointing and the rating is very deceiving.",2,negative

387790218,markham\ca\181720\188174\387790218.html,Park Inn By Radisson Toronto-Markham,"Stayed here for a week with my family in June. There are many problems with this hotel, but overall, the pros outweigh the cons. I would come back again.  Let me deliver the bad news first: - Wifi is VERY unstable. I was working during my week here, and most of the week it wasn't working in the room at all - I had better success in the front lobby / biz center. It was never clear to me if it was Roger's fault, PurePage (their ISP) or the hotel's fault, but I suspect it was some combination of the three. - Parking lot construction was very distracting, and I was not warned when I booked (6 weeks before trip). The owner refused to make any concessions. Luckily I was in a room that was away from the noise - other people were much more affected, especially with the 7 AM start. I heard from another guest that the owner didn't want to shut down the hotel and do it quickly, but chose a much slower, cheaper contractor that meant guests were inconvenienced for longer (not sure if that's true) - Swimming pool hot tub jets didn't work (first world problems, right?) - Sauna didn't work - Maid service was very uneven. We got skipped one day, and other days she did a poor job. - Location is convenient for car, but without a car, there is nothing to walk to. It's in a business park with not even a restaurant in sight.  Now that we got that out of the way, the good news: - Very clean, modern, new room. Nicely redone.  - Club Carlson Gold got me upgraded to a junior suite without asking. - Hotel property itself was very clean. The hallways could use a steam clean, but the pool area, the lobby, the business center - everything was sparkling. Seemed there was always someone working on cleaning something at all hours. - Pool area and hot tub VERY clean. Sparkling.  - Room VERY quiet (except for the construction noise). Great soundproofing from other rooms. Even though there was lots of loud families while we were there, we never heard them. - Restaurant is very good. Tasty food, especially for a hotel restaurant, and reasonable prices - burger and fries for $12 CDN. Beer for $5. Service was excellent.  - GREAT front desk staff. Always very helpful. When the parking became problematic on our checkout day (when we had to bring suitcases down), one of the front desk staff met us outside immediately, moved his car from a prime spot to a much further spot so we could easily pack up. - Very friendly, helpful owner, Edmond (although not generous with concessions/comps). When the wifi wasn't working and I had to make a presentation to deliver for my work requiring internet, he offered to hotspot his personal cell phone to get me connected. He worked hard with me as he struggled with Rogers to get the hotel back online. He did everything that I could expect him to do in his situation.  We'd stay here again. Our main gripes are really the wifi and the construction, but that was just bad timing!

In that way, it more closely resembles the results of piecemeal independent hotel renovation than that of an experienced hotel chain's, and overall I was disappointed in the appearance of things for a 3.5 star rating per the usual sources.   But the hotel is well-situated at a convenient intersection of freeways on the outskirts of central Toronto.

I booked through Priceline and had a mixup with the rates booking through Name your Price vs. booking independently. When I called the hotel, the reception was quite courteous and sympathetic and referred me to a manager who would be available the next morning. On calling the next morning, a Different manager was available to speak to me (Gary Kirel) who didnt really care about the circumstances of my call or what I had to say. He simply cut me off repeatedly despite my attempts to say I had no desire to cancel my stay - just to inquire about getting the lower rate adjustment that was available on the same website I had booked on. His rudeness and lack of ""customer service"" really put me off. I have worked many years in the CS industry and currently work in Customer Experience across various spectrums including Hospitality so naturally this conversation irked me.

The location is convenient by car; however, there is nothing of interest within walking distance (nearest place to buy food is easily a 30min walk). The pool was warm, and the hot tub was really nice. The price was fair. A small fridge and a microwave were provided in-unit, and the TV show selection was what you would expect. The bathroom was updated and pretty nice. The staff members were pretty friendly. We had no issues finding parking on-premises, and it was included in the price of the room.  That said, there were a few issues encountered during our stay. First, the beds were rather lumpy, and my party and I often awoke sore. The worst was probably the loud and undependable A/C unit in the suite. If you weren't waking up due to the bed quality, it was because the A/C turns on and is extremely loud every 15min Or the A/C doesn't turn on at all and you sweat yourself awake. We had to call down everyday for more pillows, and half the time room service forgot to bring them to us. At one point, we waited just under an hour before giving up and going to bed. The rooms were also rather small, and extra furniture i.e. a random ottoman and chair were crammed into the room, thus making the room both cramped and difficult to navigate. Some minor concerns were peeling wallpaper and damaged lampshades. The women's change room / toilet in the pool area was broken for the entirety of our stay (four days).  I would stay here again if it were a last resort, but I'd personally exhaust all of my other options beforehand.

A relatively new hotel addition in the area. Convenient to most major travel arteries, and less than 30 minutes drive into Toronto depending on traffic.

LCD television, lots of drawer and closet space, big mirror by the door. Beds were comfortable enough but nothing special. Free wi-fi that we used regularly, a typical amenity for hotels in this area.

Overall, a good place to take the girlfriend/boyfriend or spouse after date night. clean room, good service. no complaints. Booked the more economical room for $100 but there are nicer more spacious rooms if your able to budget more.",4,positive

We rented a suite so that my brother can sleep on the pull-out sofa and I sleep in the room. The layout of the suite is not good. All seem so tiny and crowded. Even though the hotel is new but the color of the carpet and the bathroom look so old. I don't have extra blankets in the room and we have to go downstairs to ask for it. The lobby looks more attractive than the room. The complimentary breakfast is good enough but if you feel for some beacon and eggs you have to pay the price on the menu ($9.00) and the hotel will reimburse you $3.00 back and not as indicated by the hotel Management Rep on the review that the guest only pays $3.00 for the hot meal. There is lots of parking space available for free. I will try some other hotels in the future.,3,negative

I came to the hotel 2 weeks ago and asked if I could look at the actual rooms. Front desk staff Mahdi was very helpful and was happy to show me at least 5 different rooms. I had chosen Riviera because of the jacuzzi and the huge glass shower box beside it.   A little disappointed with the check-in because when I booked the room I told them that since we would need the room after the wedding is over (which would be way after midnight), they could have my credit card info and everything so then when we arrive we could just grab the key and go. Unfortunately we still had to go through all the normal check-in process while carrying 2 wedding dresses and suitcases.  The Riviera room is BEAUTIFUL and spotless. Absolutely comfortable bed and covers. There's also a mini fridge and a microwave. The closet is big enough for a 2-week stay. There are 2 huge flat screen tv in the room, one facing the bed, one facing the jazucci (how thoughtful!) Water pressure for the shower is good. There's also a shower head on the top which the water would go straight to the top of your head - great for washing hair. If you're coming from a party and has a ton of hairspray in your hair, make sure to bring your own conditioner because the one in the room is not too good.  Overall our stay was good.

I woke up the morning of Sept 18th with 3 horribly swollen fingers and several other bites and found 3 bed bugs in my bed (2 dead, one alive) which I put in a cup to show management (I took a picture of them also). It took 4 calls to get someone to come up to my room. It was 6am and no one offered to move me to a different room to get ready, or send anyone up. When the front desk rep, the maintenance manager and the housekeeping manager finally came to my room (2 hours after my initial complaint), and saw the 'specimens', they finally seemed took my issue seriously and started ripping apart the room. When the hotel finally contacted me to discuss this issue, they assured me this was an isolated incident (ie. in my room only - not sure how they knew this - would suggest wishful thinking...) and they had called the pest control company (which they did and they faxed me a copy of the work order that had been performed on my room). What concerned me, beyond having front line staff not have any idea how to handle this issue, nor be empowered to do anything (they couldn't do anything because management was in an all day offsite meeting), was the fact that my bed was getting ripped apart by 3 people with their everyday uniforms on. If it truly was an isolated incident, it may not be anymore now given that these people may well have shaken bugs onto their clothes and given them a free ride around the hotel.  Anyway, I appreciate the hotel management calling to me to assure me the room had been treated and taken off of the market for a while, but as a frequent business traveller, I would want to know if a hotel I was going to stay in had bed bug issues. This one does. I have the swollen red itchy bumps all over to prove it.

There have been a few human errors along they way but that is to be expected with travelling. Those errors are always rectified with apologies, discounts and done with a speed that often amazes me for such a busy hotel. I love this hotel and could not honestly say enough about it. Anyone who does say something negative is very obviously someone who does not leave room for human error. We all make mistakes, in every job, to say we haven't would be a gross lie.

She was right. This is a really new hotel; everything is new; all equipment and amenities are functional. We didn't get the cheapest room but upgraded to a room with Jacuzzi and a king size bed for C$140/night. The room is named Riviere Room (there are many Riviere rooms in all the floors). The room is really spacious at about 500 ~ 600 sq ft, including the bathroom. The room is clean, have no weird/smokey odor. The bed linen is impressively soft and smooth. There are 2 LCD TVs and a gas fireplace. I think $140 is a very reasonable price for this centrally located motel in the York Region.  The staff were friendly during our stay, but we didn't bug them much for anything anyway.  The restaurant is expensive for dinner even if you order from the prix fixe menu. I do find the sandwich menu reasonably priced. For example, I ordered a Turkey Club sandwich that came with choice of salad, fries or sweet potato fries for C$10. The sandwich was big and can easily satisfy 1 man or 2 women's lunch hunger.  There are many restaurants in the neighbourhood. There is really no reason to dine in the restaurant.",4,positive

I thought it was worth waking up early for, but Im no picky eater.   The customer service at this hotel is top notch. Absolutely NOTHING to complain about. This hotel also offers a pool, free parking, and banquet facilities.  Another stay, another happy and satisfied guest. I wish this chain had locations across the US. I would choose Monte Carlo over other name brand hotels any day of the week. This hotel is definitely worth the extra money. I would also drive the extra distance if this hotel was in the vacinity of where Im visiting.",5,positive

The room was spacious , with two double beds and other amenities. The buffet-breakfast was on the house, with toast, cereals, fruits, yogurt and fruit juices. Optional Menu breakfast was offered for a few dollars, though we did not take the offer as the buffet was good enough.  In the night, it was a bit warm and I could not turn down the thermostat setting - the control would not change from its fixed temperature of 75 degree fahrenheit!

The location is great if you're a Chinese like me wanting to shop and dine in the nearby Chinese shopping centre. The building is new and definitely showed in the hallway carpet. Free parking is a plus. But I have 4 guests registered in the room and only have two sets of everything. I called the first day for the additional two sets thinking they will automatically refill the same amount for the next day. But not, i have to call again. However, we were impressed with their friendly staffs especially the front desk receptionist, REX. He checked us in and was ended up to be the one to deliver our extra sets of towels. He ran into my husband (happened to be getting ice) in the hallway and he was able to call him by his last name (good memory). We had cocktails in the bar and the bartender, Anthony, was very friendly and professional. The cocktails were mixed nicely. The complimentary breakfast was not much to mention. We didn't even take advantage of them due to lack of selection (don't even have hot tea). The pool is rather small and shallow. The standard room is nothing fancy. Not sure if it's because of the yellow color theme, we still feel the hotel room is old and dingy. The bathroom is very small and there is no counter space at all to even put a small amenities bag without getting wet or risking it dropping into the toilet. The towels are rather thin and cheap. So the overall experience was not impressive and don't agree it being #1, we had a better experience with the nearby Hilton. We go Markham often and we think we would rather stay in Hilton although it cost a bit more.",3,negative

I booked this through a really cheap Hotwire deal for a 3 star hotel in Markham and this is what I got. We got their basic room with a king bed and it was good. Even though they said it was a king it certainly seemed much small than that but that's ok. The rooms have everything but if you like a lot of space the room is a tad bit small but for what you're going to use the room for it should definitely suffice if you book their basic room. Continental breakfast was pretty good and the service was excellent as well. All in all I recommend this place.,5,positive

First, we tried to book a 2 queen bed regular rooms, and it was booked. So the front desk person told us that she can book us the suite. She gave me LESS THAN $20 discount on each room for having 3 rooms booked for 2 days. I was glad. But when we checked in the 2 suites were SO TINY!!! It does not even look like a queen bed. Very tiny bath, very tiny living room. And the third room was a bit spacious, but there is not even a bath tub!!! It's for disability. THE FRONT DESK SHOULD HAVE LET ME KNOW ABOUT THESE SITUATIONS!!! I was devastated since this is for my wedding and my relatives came a long way. And, when I checked the pull out bed from the sofa (room 301 very tiny room), there were blood stains on the sheets... IT'S GROSS!!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY DON'T CHECK AND CLEAN EVERYTHING!!!!! And they just said sorry, bring new sheets and lets us clean the mess!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  $129/room/night is DEFINITELY NOT WORTH IT FOR THESE THINGS.   NOT IN THE LETTER (CANNOT FIT ON SPACE): THE 2 SUITES IS A SIZE OF A REGULAR ROOM, where the living room is squeezed in!!!!!!!! (room 301 and 501). they gave free breakfast vouchers to compensate, and breakfast is not even good.... grrrrrhhhhh.. :'(   NOW I EMAILED THEM, LET'S SEE HOW THEY WILL RESPOND!!!!

This is a very nice hotel and convenient to our friend's house.  Our room was on the 4th floor away from the elevator, ice maker and vending machine. The hallway was hot but our room was clean and cool. We had to ask for extra towels from housekeeping. There were 4 guests and only 2 sets of towels. The bathroom door made such a loud noise when opening and closing the door. We didn't bother calling to get it fixed. Usually, hotels have a card/booklet with listings of the tv channels. We also couldn't find it in the room. My 7 year old daughter had a difficult time getting out of the bath tub - it seems that height was a tad higher compared to a regular tub.  On our first morning at the hotel, we went to to have breakfast downstairs. It's just your typical continental breakfast - bread, pastries, coffee, teas, juices and fresh fruits. They do have a menu that you can order from but no one mentioned it to us. The staff was too busy organizing the food.  My kids were excited to try the pool, buy it was closed on Sunday for maintenance and opened Monday afternoon.   Overall, I was happy to stay in this hotel and would do it again.

In particular the front desk staff (Mahdy). He is very professional and attentive. He took the time to show us the different type of rooms with positive attitude.

Hotel was wonderful , you could tell they pour their money into the lobby, rooms were great , bed too firm for me. Staff at the front desk were Fab. The cleaning staff Fab. Breakfast, not kid friendly and for most adults I prefer not to have a sugar rush for breakfast. I am not one for danishes and pastries for the first meal of the day and neither is my daughter. Only 1 toaster oven for what over 500 guests . They did offer cereal. Breakfast area was very small. My daughter usually wakes up hungry, I prefer a coffee and a shower. Hubby decided to go down just to get her a small bowl of cereal and us a couple of coffee's to hold her until we were ready to eat. Well forget that one, My husband was greeted by KESHA. Wait greeted is a nice word and she was not. She was rude to him and told him he could not have anything as we all had to be there with our breakfast coupon. So needles to say I had a bird bath and our friends and I went to breakfast. We had the hubby's stand in line while we had to go to the front desk to get the coupons. We go back to the line up and as we walked up to our husbands KESHA was rude and told me I was not allowed to go to the front of the line as there was a line up. I said to her, ahh this is my daughter and husband and they were standing in the until we got our coupon, when my girlfriend heard her talk to me the way she did, she walked back into the lobby until we got a table as she could not believe the way this women spoke to us. So heads up for families with small children. Bring the little boxes of cereal and milk with you unless you plan on eating as soon as you get up. Also get to breakfast before 8:30 or plan on waiting at least half hour to 45 minutes in line.

Hotel is top-notch and will be a mainstay location for all future travel to the area. The room, common areas, and grounds are super clean. Comfortable bed--slept very well. Layout of the basic room is a little odd with a 3/4 wall and column separating bed from sitting area which made for a tight space toward the desk area. Also one minor nitpick--The bathroom toilet seat/arrangement is best for very small people. Onsite restaurant food is excellent--had 3 dinners there rather than going out. Service staff in the restaurant is very friendly. Complimentary breakfast is cold offerings but very good selection. You can also apply complimentary breakfast as a $3 credit toward a hot meal.

It is also very busy with conferences, weddings, etc. Upon checking in we found the staff to be very helpful and friendly. We were assigned a room on the 3rd floor.  The halls were very clean and you noticed the absence of odours of any kind. Our room was a standard size with 2 queen beds, 42"" flat screen tv, fridge, microwave, coffee maker, etc. There was virtually anything you'd need for a stay. The a/c worked extremely well and was very quiet. The beds were very comfortable and had 5 pillows on each. The only drawback in the entire room was the 'plastic glasses' in the washroom. Surely such an elegant place could provide glass. It made me feel I was in a Motel 6!  Breakfast the next morning was interesting! You go to the Front Desk and stand in line to receive a voucher for each person in your room. Then you proceed to the restaurant and wait to be seated. The Staff does their best but it can be chaotic. You have a choice of the free continental breakfast or paying for a hot breakfast. The 'freebie' is largely pastries and breads along with a selection of assorted fruit sliced and diced.   The Hotel is situated on Warden, which is a main artery. It is handy to anywhere in Markham and is about a 20 minutes drive to downtown Toronto. I was very impressed with this Hotel and given the opportunity, I will return.",4,positive

We were greeted at the desk by the charming ""Mae"" who even partially walked us to our room when I looked a little perplexed ( in my tired state of mind) where the room was. The corridor was beautiful, as was the rooms. My bed was very comfortable, allowing me a good night's sleep. My only negative is that there is very little counter space so if 2 women are traveling with bags of make-up, etc., beware of this! There was handicapped parking right near the door so we were pleased to be able to use this.  On line I had read that there was basically a pastry based breakfast, that I was thus prepared to skip. To our delight, there was in fact fresh cut up fruit, delicious muffins, toast with peanut butter, jams, etc. When my mom wanted decaf coffee they quickly got her some. The breakfast room hostess was warm and very helpful. So I am glad to say that this was a very good place to stay and that we were not disappointed!",4,positive

However, My disappointment started upon arrival. First of all, I was told when I booked the room over the phone, that the suite had a separate door to the bedroom, as we have two young children and the separate door helps them sleep better. When we checked in I realized the room they gave us did NOT have a separate door to the bedroom, and I was told that only one room in the whole place had that. So I asked to be moved to that room, and they insisted on charging me for the upgrade (about $20-$30 dollars) even though it was their mistake. There was one manager who was trying to be sympathetic to our situation, but if he really wanted to have good customer service, he would not have charged me for an upgrade at all. I was too weary to fight it, but figured it would be worth it to have a really nice suite. Well the suite was TINY! It was very nice but TINY, which is useless with two little ones. It ended up being a horrible night, as we were cramped and the kids would not sleep. The breakfast was also disappointing in selection and quality and we didn't even use the pool as it was little, and crowded. The decor in the hotel has some nice features, but our experience was very poor and we will not go back, especially with young children. The impression I get from the managers is that they are 'cheap' and don't understand that doing certain things to help customer satisfaction will help them have return customers and spread word of mouth to new customers. Exactly what these reviews do too.",2,negative

187114010,markham\ca\181720\2277075\187114010.html,Monte Carlo Inn &amp; Suites Downtown Markham,"I had to stay at this hotel in October 2013 for a period of two weeks. This hotel was very busy during my stay, and I feel the staff did a really good job with keeping everyone satisfied. The staff member that stood out the most to me is the woman that works the breakfast in the hotel restaurant. Every morning when I walked in she would greet me and was very friendly. The only complaints I have are:  1. The room I was in (standard king) was very small. There was a little table and chairs crammed in along one side of the bed which I never used. After two weeks of living in such tight quarters I was happy to leave!    2. The business center has two computers. There are no instructions on how to log on or what password to use, which made me go back to the front desk and wait 15 minutes to ask due to someone checking in, and there only being one staff on at the time. When I was logged on and needed to print some things out for my training the next day, the printer was out of paper. So back to the front desk and this time only a 10 minutes wait. I was provided with a small stack of paper to finally print out what I needed. I then went to print again and low and behold there is no toner in the printer. I tried using the other printer only to have this occur again. The printers are of poor quality to begin with, which surprised me as this hotel seems to have frequent business guests. I feel this is something the hotel needs to look into if they are going to advertise that they have a business centre. (no I did not end up being able to print anything).   If I returned to Markham and had a choice of hotel to stay at I would not pick the Monte Carlo. This has nothing to do with the staff or location. I would just prefer a standard size hotel room over the small one I was crammed into for two weeks. If you're only staying for a short period of time this hotel is more then sufficient.

I booked 2 nights at this Inn and the experience was incredible. We arrived late on Wednesday night and were cold and frazzled and at the end of our rope...our room, booked via priceline, was not available...the Night Duty manager (who was working Christmas night) stepped in and arranged for us to take a Riviera Suite for the cost of a simple King room. With such compassion and consideration my wife and I were treated to a fantastic room and were able to luxuriate in comfort and heat. We used the jacuzzi, we lounged, it was all a weary traveller could ever want. Then to top it off...the Dining room - Menaggio I believe it is called, is operated by top of the line food service professionals who are kind, helpful and considerate. The Kitchen is staffed by top of the line chefs who hand make incredible food at incredible prices. The Kitchen/Dining room is 5***** and is a hidden gem in Markham.

The bathrooms are of a good size.  On the first time round, I had a problem with my remote control upon which I was moved to another room (Mai at the front desk helped me with this). However, I have to qualify this help that my complain was not taken seriously at the beginning as the remote worked on the reception tv.  The breakfast ""included option"" is misleading. It does not include hot items. For the hot items they give you a coupon that gives a discount if you choose to order from the hot item menu. Otherwise,the free breakfast includes bread, cookies, cream cheese, butter, jam, coffee, tea, juice, and cereal. I paid an extra 8 dollars for an omelette and 5 potato cubes.  On the first stay, the wifi was perfect, on the second visit it started to kick in i.e. work at 12am in the morning.   The microwave and fridge are very clean and in working condition. Also there are complimentary coffee/sugar in the rooms.   I have not tried the swimming pool but I saw nobody in the facility    I have ordered dinner twice in the room.

The room was advertised with ""big flat panel TV,"" but when we turned it on all that was available was basic cable. Lame.   The restaurant, while we only had the continental breakfast, was beautiful and the service was good. The coffee was swill.. perhaps the carafes they serve it in needed to be cleaned.

203287525,markham\ca\181720\2277075\203287525.html,Monte Carlo Inn &amp; Suites Downtown Markham,"My family and I stayed for 2 nights last weekend and generally had a great experience. The rooms are quite clean and comfortable, and the pool was well used. The only issue we had with our room was that the Toilet stopped working on the last day.  If there is one area to complain about it is the on site restaurant. We had bought a package deal that was suppose to include breakfast buffet each morning. First, it was a bit odd that we needed to approach the front desk each morning to claim the breakfast vouchers, and second, the term ""buffet"" was a bit far fetched. When we presented the breakfast vouchers at the restaurant we were given the option of Cold buffet or $3 off a hot breakfast menu item (cheapest menu item was $10).  The cold buffet is what we chose since even at $6 for a full breakfast ($3 off included) we did not feel it was worth the extra cost when we could have gone to Pickle Barrel and got something much more for $4.99. The cold buffet really should be called ""continental"" because the choices were pretty lacking:  Juice - apple, cranberry, orange - the orange juice was quite watered down Coffee - Seattle's best Coffee - Does anyone there know how to make a good cup of coffee? This stuff was watery and cold Sweet - Muffin or cookies (depending on the day - but seriously, cookies for breakfast?) Pastry - Either Danish or Croissant (depending on the day) Two Cereal types - Honey Nut Cherrios, Raisin Bran Bread or bagel - very dry Fruit salad Yogurt - Activia  The adobe would be acceptable if this was considered Continental, but when they say buffet, you expect something a bit more... meat or cheese selection, hard boiled eggs, oatmeal, or even a waffle station, none of which were even available.  One last comment I'd like to make is regarding the pool. this Salt water pool was generally well maintained, but the hotel seemed to have issues keeping the water temperature constant or even the room temperature. The first day the room was generally warm and the pool was bath water temperature like. The second time in, the room was hotter than a sauna, and the pool was still quite warm. The third time (the next day) the room was temperate, and the pool was quite cold. Also, my son discovered a spider at the bottom of the pool - a bit odd.",4,positive

The only issue was that the check-in could have been smother. I was surprised to learn that a $100 deposit is required upon check-in. I would have preferred to have been made aware of this in advance. Moreover, you must provide the front desk with the make, model, and license plate of your vehicle if you are using your parking lot, which was also a surprise, Finally, the front desk failed to inform us that vouchers were necessary in order to have breakfast. This resulted in us going to the restaurant in the morning, only to be told that we had to return to the front desk to obtain our vouchers and then return to the restaurant. In all three cases (the deposit, the vehicle information, and the breakfast vouchers), I can understand why these policies are in place. However, I think advance notice and better front desk service should make these issues less of a surprise for guests.",4,positive

Extremely clean and with all the amenities of more expensive hotels, the lovely front desk girls are always pleasing to talk to when I check in and when I have a question (one of them remembered me on only my second stay here!). The room has an extremely powerful air conditioner which is good since I like to sleep in a cold room. The room I had on this particular trip was close to the elevators, but I barely heard any noise from it. The gym located in the basement is quite basic but still provided me with a good workout so I didn't have to feel guilty eating out 4 days straight. I wish I woke up at a reasonable time to take advantage of the included breakfast. Maybe next time, because for my next stay in Markham I will definately book a room at the Monte Carlo!

As more and more people were without power, the GTA converged on hotels. The staff was not the least bit phased by the event and tended to our needs happily. From almost full vacancy to completely booked, the service never suffered. Even on Christmas Eve day, they allowed my wife and daughter to check out at 3:30pm rather than the usual time as they had to wait for me to pick them up after work. They even gave my daughter crafts to do and a few complimentary treats. I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone coming to the Greater Toronto Area.

They were all more than helpful in giving us maps and direction. We built an instant bond with their friendship. The Inn is still very new and clean. The rooms were very quiet and they gave us the top fifth floor. We live in Alliston and this hotel will be on our list to stay at if we are sightseeing or attending shows in Toronto. You can not beat no parking. It is a better alternative than staying right downtown. I also have to mention a continental breakfast was included and here the staff was very friendly too.

It was a surprise romance package he had pre-booked for a memorable evening without our children. We stayed in the suite with a jacuzzi tub, full glass shower, as well as a comfortable king size bed. The restaurant menu was amazing. The pork tenderloin and steak was melt in your mouth delicious. Since I have a gluten allergy, I was quite happy to have them cook for me to suit my needs. The atmosphere was comfortable. It could have been a bit more romantic, such as a secluded area away from kids and general public. a designated waitress would have been nice instead of the bartender coming out to take our order in between making drinks for other customers. it simply felt like we were having a 5 star meal in an average hotel lobby restaurant .It truly lacked the intimacy and ambiance that we were expecting to have at dinner. Even a simple candle and a long table cloth would have made it feel more pampering. However, we did make up for it in the beautiful room with dessert. The breakfast was a perfect start to our busy morning. We will definitely be back. Sue and front desk staff were very accommodating and friendly, and tended to our needs.   Mr. and Mrs. Messina.

We found it to be a fine hotel; more specifically, the hotel staff are not only efficient, but helpful and even ""charming"". (We wish to mention Eloise as being especially so.) Our room was most satisfactory.  However, the food services were, in our judgement, quite unsatisfactory. Everything was going very well until we went to breakfast. We seemed to have seen promotional offerings of ""Breakfast is on Us"" with pictures of a full breakfast plate, leading us to think that we were in for a complete cooked breakfast. Not so fast..... In fact, all that was on ""us"" was a ""continental"" breakfast. This turned out to be the most miserable continental breakfast we had seen in the past twenty years; even the most downmarket hotels would easily outscore it. Electing to have the ""pay for"" breakfast, things went downhill. The sausage was so overcooked as to be beyond even a hungry man's threshold, there were six pieces of hash brown potatoes that had been reduced to charcoal and the bacon promised by the menu was not to be found. In short, it was a sad business. Our recommendation is that travellers should consider the Motel Carlo a good place to stop but bring your own food.",4,positive

We didn't go for breakfast either as it was jam packed. Another thing before our stay I called and asked if they had playpens and they said no. We got to the hotel and read in the room binder that you can get them for 10.00. Was glad we brought our own cause no other hotel has charged to use one.

Has automatic doors and both front and rear allowing for easy entry with luggage. Landscaping is beautiful, both front and back with two large water fountain displays.  Safe, mini-fridge, microwave, lots of drawer space, desk to work @ with plugs up top and not underneath. Two chairs for a sitting area with table so you do not have to watch TV in bed. Lots of cupboard space.   Check in was a breeze, I just gave them my last name and they pulled up my reservation. They did ask if we wanted a room with a Jacuzzi, but for $40 more to me that is not really worth it. In hindsight it might have been since they do not have a hot tub, indoor or outdoor, just a pool. The hotel does have a coin operated washer and dryer located on the bottom floor next to the fitness room. This is also where a lot of the conference rooms are located.  Fitness room is a decent size, although the universal weight machine was out of order. I did not see any free weights, but they do have a universal cable machine. There are a couple treadmills, elliptical machines, and bikes if I recall.  My complaints are, no soap dish in the bathroom which makes cleaning harder and creates bacteria. Water pressure could be a little better from the shower heads and it is somewhat dark while showering, so they could use a light fixture there. Personal preference thing, but I did not like the carpeting, but it does go with the decor of the rest of the room. All of these are minor though, and did not detract from our stay.",5,positive
213325306,markham\ca\181720\2277075\213325306.html,Monte Carlo Inn &amp; Suites Downtown Markham,"I've traveled a bit, but this is the first time that I ever wrote a review, and a long one, bear with me. This was my 2nd time staying at Monte Carlo inn at Warden ,which is close to our Canadian office. Last year's stay was uneventful, it's clean, convenient location and a good price for its value. Yet true values of a hotel or rather of hotel's management surface when accident happens, which exemplified by my 2nd stay last month from 6/16-6/18. On June 17th, after a full day meetings and a late dinner, it was almost 11pm when I got near Warden area. For some reason, all the roads leading to the hotel was blocked, yellow tapes everywhere, the whole area was completely dark, the hotel in the distance was similar to a ghost castle. My old GPS took me round and round for almost an hour, just couldn't get close to the hotel. Police car's lights blinking in the distance, couldn't find anyone who could tell me what happened, whether the hotel was open for business. I parked the car outside one taping road block and walked 300meters to find someone working in the darkness: apparently the lighting hit several power poles in the day time, broken powerlines scattering on warden ave since 6pm, cars hit by the poles too. Failed to find way to the hotel parking lot (next day my coworker told me there's a dirt road leading to the back of the parking lot, which obviously was not shown via my GPS), I had to find a parking space in a shopping plaza 1 mile away, walked in my heels in the dark back to hotel, carefully avoiding stepping on the lying powerlines. no electricity, no hot water, a few front desk employees lit candles and use flash lights to lead customers to their rooms and rest rooms. The employees were apologetic, even if it's not their fault. I threw myself to bed without taking a cold shower, but hit myself by the bathtub : remember bathroom is the darkest place without electricity. The next morning (6/18) the free breakfast was provided even if the power was not up yet. I was supposed to stay for another night, I decided I need a shower and can't stay in a hotel without electricity for another night. Even if I got into my room at 6pm, the employee informed the manager that I wanted to check out and need their help to find a room for me. The young handsome manager told me right away that they won't charge me for the night, told me all the hotels nearby were booked. After he found out that I would have an early morning flight next morning, he picked up the phone right away and booked me a spa suite at its airport franchise for the same rate I would pay at his hotel for a regular room. Then he walked me to the parking lot while we chatted. I was very impressed with his confidence and capability in dealing with emergencies. He became a manager when he was 22 (to be in charge of hotel), he liked IT. He was able to get the phone IP up during the day via the power from the in house generator. He help customers to find rooms else where, truly making people feel home away from home. I could tell he's the heart and sole of the hotel which he manages, and his people trust him. Today I was informed by our Canadian office that the hotel also refund our first night stay (the one without electricity). I told him the owner is lucky to have him as the manager, someone is fully empowered to make decision and capable to make any decision that makes customer happy. A hotel's value is always better represented by its ""software"" (people, service) than hardware. Five star hotel's service coming from training, but sometimes the politeness and smile associated with the expectation of tips; a boutique hotel's service such as Monte Carlo Inn (Warden) makes you feel that they really care, and the smile and apologies are from their hearts.  I definitely recommend it and I will stay there again next time I am in Toronto. Thanks, Shaharyar (I believe that's the manager's name), for making a disaster a service triumph.",5,positive

The breakfast isn't great either especially if you're used to big continental breakfasts but there is a Starbucks within a 10 minute walk which we went to pretty much every day.

The rooms were clean and large, each room has a microwave, fridge and safe. There is onsite washer and dryer as well.   Check out was as easy as check in was. I was impressed that the clerk who had checked us in the day before (and not the one checking us out) remembered us and addressed me by name.  I would like to discuss a few comments others have made.  When checking in, the desk clerk was very clear that they offered a continental breakfast free. This type of breakfast is normally toast, bagels, muffins, coffee and juice and this was exactly what was offered.   Other folks complained that they had to pickup a voucher each morning for this, I fully understand why they do this, to ensure that only registered guest receive the free breakfast. The hotel could possible hand these dated vouchers out when you check in to save you a few steps in the morning. Some guest would make it appear that to obtain these vouchers was a time consuming and took them out of there way. When you step off the elevator, you turn right approx 25 feet to the front desk. This is not taking you out of your way.  Overall excellent stay, good room good value and easy to get around. For those wondering this hotel is advertised as Markham downtown, its approx 3-5 minutes north of Steeles on Warden, minutes from the edge of Scarborough, 10-15 minutes north of the 401 at Warden.

Frankly, it's just not as professional and and good as the brand-name ones. I stayed in a Jacuzzi suite. Room was crowded. The A/C barely worked and the room was stuffy.

We were visiting family who could not accommodate us so we wanted somewhere comfortable and not too expensive. Monte Carlo fitted the bill more than adequately. The Reception Staff were friendly and helpful, our room was well appointed with all that one would expect. The coffee provided with the coffee maker was the best we've had for some time. We enjoyed two nights peaceful sleep. Good to find a copy of the National Post awaiting us at the door each morning.  We dined in the restaurant on our first evening. Don't expect top quality, cordon blue cuisine here but you will get a perfectly adequate meal at modest cost. Breakfast is provided within the room price. This is continental and perfectly satisfying for the start of the day. Breakfast can be upgraded to a cooked meal at extra cost. Ordered ""Eggs Any Style"" and again, whilst not an outstanding meal, it was perfectly adequate. The hotel boasts a pool.

And why do you need a ""hold"" on a credit card anyway?  We found our standard room to be rather small, even compared with older hotels. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. I even got over the fiberglass shower insert in the bathroom. But the bathroom lighting is quite dim, and you are backlit when using the mirror. Even the room light is dim. I'm all for energy saving bulbs, but if you have them, then have enough lamps to light the space. I did find the pool to be very nice. Also, the continental breakfast was adequate, despite the breakfast staff pushing the extra cost hot breakfast.   But the biggest turn off for me happened when I asked to change a $20 US bill to get coins to use in the hotel laundry room. The front desk charged me 10%--$2--just to change my more valuable US currency to the less valuable Canadian dollar. So instead of giving me an even exchange, which netted the hotel 10% on the par exchange, which was OK with me, the Monte Carlo charged me an extra 10%. Now I know why they call it the Monte Carlo, because bringing your moey here is a gamble.
 
 
 Room Tip:  Try and get a room near the elevators--it's a long walk to some rooms.

We are from out of town and had never heard of this chain. Not expecting much , when we arrived we were pleasantly surprised at how nice this hotel was! It seems quite new and is very clean and spacious. We upgraded to the jacuzzi suite and it was great! Bed was big and comfortable and the jacuzzi was spacious and clean as well.   Room came with a complacently breakfast which turned out to be a ""semi warm"" buffet. There was basic things like croissants, bagels, toast and muffins - but all seemed hard and stale. It was fine for a free meal - you can find a little something to eat, but it wasn't the best meal.   All in all it was a great stay. Would go back",5,positive

Refrigerator, TV, microwave, safety box are all nice.  I had certainly expected some meat and eggs in the breakfast but was surprised that those are for purchase. Have stayed at lesser cost hotels that provided better breakfasts. I think this set up is rather cheap.  Checked out at the same time with a friend (adjacent room) and found we were charged different rates (because we booked separately and with different websites). When I inquired about that, I got this rather gruff reply ""It is our policy"" and no satisfactory rationale. Because the people at the counter were of no help, I ask for their supervisor.... who was conveniently not in yet, until a much later time.  The monetary difference is not all that much but the lack of conciliatory tone from the desk staff indicates more ""people skills"" are required of their staff.",4,positive

242347624,markham\ca\181720\2277075\242347624.html,Monte Carlo Inn &amp; Suites Downtown Markham,"This Nov was our second time at Monte Carlo in Markham. We use to stay at Delta on Kennedy in Markham it was getting too expensive. MC was cheaper and better. Plus it is closer to shopping and other key locations. More centralized. Both stays we were able to find deals through Expedia or Booking.com. We paid under $100 per night compared to $130-150 at Delta.  Your stay includes a breakfast every morning. I wouldn't actually call it a breakfast. It's juice, coffee or tea, danish, croissant, toast. Good enough to fill you up until lunch but if you want a hot meal, you can order that too from the menu (for a cost of course). Unfortunately, that is the only place to eat at MC. It would be nice if they had more of a variety or a better restaurant. That's ok though because near by there are plenty of places to eat and shop. Just don't try walking in -6 temperatures. Toronto air is so dry and cold.  The first time we had the double queen bed room and this time was a single king bed room. If you want a little extra room, go for the double queen bed room. We were on the 5th floor and it was very quiet with somewhat of a view. Regardless, I prefer high floors. I emailed the hotel prior to arriving and requested we be put on a high floor. They replied and said that they will do their best. We got what we wanted. The staff responding to emails are great and very responsive. The front counter staff are also very good. Kind and polite.  The rooms were very clean as far as we can tell. The furniture was very new and modern. Each room comes with a microwave and a small fridge. Very handy and rare for this level of hotel but a great feature. The bathroom was clean as well, though a little small. They refresh the soap, shampoo, etc as needed. Even these items were nice. Some sort of green tea fragrance.  Hotel has free wifi and it was not slow either. Very good wifi speeds.  If you plan to go to MC more than once, be sure to sign up for their rewards card. They have some ok rewards. It's free to sign up and well worth it. You can earn a night in their room with a jacuzzi.   The only complaint, and it really isn't a complaint, more of an annoyance is their ballroom is always booked. At least the times when we were there. Loud music and sometime party goers roaming around. That's just me so don't let this discourage you. The guests are still reasonably polite.  I would definitely recommend anyone staying in Markham to stay at this location. Lots of parking too if you are driving or renting a car. We are heading back again in Aug 2015 and will stay there again.

The restaurant and front desk staff were very friendly and helpful.  The free breakfast was a little small but included bagels, and a variety of pastries, fruit salad as well as your choice of cereal and, of course, free coffee.  The rooms were clean and offered plenty of room. The only issue I had with the room was the fact that even though my room offered 2 large screen HD tvs they only offered a limited amount of cable channels on the TV and none of the channels were in HD quality. Plus in this day and age of Satellite or Digital Cable TV there was no program guide available on the TV to list shows that were airing or coming up.  On my floor there was a vending machine for drinks that was out of service from the day I arrived until the day I left 7 days later.  The only other surprise came on check in when I had to pay a $100 deposit on a prepaid room, I've stayed in Hotels across Canada and this was new to me. Not a big deal as it was fully refunded on checkout but perhaps simply taking down the credit card info, as most other hotels do, would be sufficient so that if there are extra charges they can be taken off the credit card.  All in all I would happily stay here again on business or pleasure.

The negative parts:  -We found multiple hairs in the bed(!) and on the bathroom soap, that were NOT the length and colour of mine or my partner's hair. -The bathroom exhaust fan was partly broken, and very loud and rattly - clearly audible over the shower or the blow-dryer. This made it very unpleasant for whoever's using the bathroom, as there's no way to turn the off the fan unless you want to use the bathroom in the dark. -The drinking glasses are thin, cheap plastic disposable glasses, not real glasses like in most hotels. -The lamps in the room use blue-tone CFL bulbs, lending the room an industrial-type feeling. -All the pillows are very thick, so you have to sleep with your neck bent upwards. -Access to the hotel is confusing - our taxi driver had to turn around in the middle of a busy street, because he couldn't find where the driveway entrance was.  The positive things: -Check-in and check-out were efficient and pleasant. -The decor of the room was relatively modern, i.e. looks to be within the last 10 years.  Perhaps our experience was atypical, but it was definitely not to be repeated. In all, I'd say that this is a lower-grade motel, masquerading as a hotel.",2,negative

This hotel was no exception.  Rooms were quiet and clean, although the bathroom had about 20 long black hairs on the floor-that was a little weird because everything else was clean.  I agree with other reviewers about the breakfast... I was slightly disappointed to learn that a hot breakfast came with a price tag. I don't remember paying for eggs at the other locations. Not a big deal, just seems like a bad business move to have guests leaving and this being one of the last things they remember about their stay.  Staff were very pleasant.",4,positive

It's a heavily Chinese populated area, which, to me, means great food. There's a big mall area where there's a giant Chinese supermarket (T&T) with great food and a lot of restaurants around it. I ate well. The hotel was adequate. The included breakfast was only a very small continental buffet so I ordered off the menu for extra cost. I didn't eat at the restaurant otherwise as there was so many Asian restaurants within walking distance. If you had a question, the staff was very nice and very helpful but I didn't feel like they offered to help. The rooms were adequate. Not bad but not great. My room kinda smelled bad but it wasn't terrible. The coffee pot wasn't washed out after I'd used it but for me it's no big deal since I was the one who used it. The reason I went there was I was there for a fencing competition and it was walking distance to the fencing club where the tournament was held. I really didn't see many other hotels in the area. Overall, I enjoyed my stay. The location to many Asian stores and restaurants really made the difference for me. It looks like the tournament will be there again next year and so will I!",4,positive

278322341,markham\ca\181720\2277075\278322341.html,Monte Carlo Inn &amp; Suites Downtown Markham,"Staff Very accommodating, flexible and friendly. Our guests had a great time, and the staff were flawless in making the check ins, banquet reception, and check outs smooth. The breakfast times can get a bit hectic depending on how many come down though.  Venue Beautifully decorated, bright, and spacious. It is a new building and looks very modern. The banquet room has 4 giant doors that make it look grand with ample seating space in the foyer. We had a photo booth set up outside and a late night snack station. For the affordable price, could have easily been much more.  Food It was above average and well presented. My wife and I did not get to eat much but guests seemed pleased. The late night station was raved about.   Rooms Clean, cheap and quiet. With a small increase in price you can get jacuzzi rooms which were awesome.  Location Downtown mark ham, meaning it's a bit further from the city life stuff in toronto. Perfect for those wanting to be away from the busy city but close enough to make day outings. Be warned if you wanted busy city life stuff, might want to look closer to downtown.  We had an incident with an independent sound system mover who treated our organizer rudely, but even then she let us know professionally and we fixed it without any drama.   In conclusion, wedding wise, it's affordable, better value for the buck, and stress free(from the venue perspective)  Rooms

Had an electrical problem in first room, and they quickly moved me to a second room. Printed out local restaurant directions, etc. which was a big help. Only unpleasantness: rude tall older woman at the desk who was not following the conversation and barked something about the electrical problem being our fault: totally off topic. I lost my clear plastic retainer apparently during the move, which will cost $200.00 to replace, AND several hundreds of dollars when I was out of the room. Both were dismissed out of hand. The money was dismissed with a ,""Our girls have returned diamond rings from their rooms.(that they have found while cleaning.)"" and the message was that I was trying to scam them. I left Canada, as a result, with $20.00 The room was large, clean, and for a few more dollars you should get a room with a jaccuzzi: although there are no bars to assist you in getting out of it, it was clean and very relaxing. You can watch TV from it as well! The pool is kind of oddly placed right in the lobby, so you kind of feel like a goldfish. The wait staff were pleasant and accommodating. and the food good. They could do a lot more with their outside area by the pool, (wait service, music, lounge chairs, etc.) and maybe public entertainment in the evenings. They seem to do a lot of private affairs, which were interesting to see. If you have a car, this hotel is in a good location, too. Overall, barring the money loss and the night guard loss, my stay there was very pleasant, and , with the exception of the barking brunette, the staff were amazing!

You can walk in but not drive up to. I am in a walking cast and had to walk from the back of the hotel where the parking was to get to the check in desk and then a distance to the elevators. I probably wouldn't have been so ticked off except I had called the hotel desk a couple days before and said that I couldn't walk far and requested a room near an elevator. They could have told me I couldn't be dropped off at the front door. Also, there are probably 20 rooms on one side of the hotel floor. My room was at the end of the hall, 20 doors away from the elevator. Again, I'm in a cast. The continental breakfast had little to choose from so they up sold you from the breakfast menu for a price ranging $7+.

However, for a relative pittance (about $5) you can enjoy a hot breakfast from a lengthy menu full of options. The pool is perfect, the workout room is efficient.

A wailing air con in my first room, ground floor, had me awake at night thinking a siren was going off. Change of room to the 3rd floor was essentially an upgrade to a very spacious room. Note - all the rooms on the 3rd floor looked spacious. Breakfast was basic , continental style, though for equivalent of £2.50p you could upgrade to a cooked egg, bacon and chips pig out.

Once you arrive, you have to walk across the interior to the front desk which is at the front corner of the building. I was thinking that this is a bad setup, but it couldn't be worse, could it? Yup... the swimming pool is right next to the front desk, so if you want to have a swim, you have to do it in full view of everyone checking in.... not for the shy.  The decor was fine. The hallways were kept quite warm. The heating/air conditioner for the room was loud. The bathroom was in excellent shape, though the choice of green tea for a shampoo scent is something I didn't appreciate. The bed (a little soft for me) had lots of pillows. Microwave and small fridge in the room. Luggage rack in the cupboard. A pretty good setup, all around, but nothing spectacular. The digital cable kept on giving us errors one night.  Breakfast was nicely setup, though the ""get a ticket"" system seemed a little odd to us for something that is included for all guests. Breakfast was continental, choice of white, whole wheat breads and bagel. Only 2 of the 4 slots of the toaster worked and in spite of it being clearly broken, it wasn't fixed or replaced. (A 4 slice toaster is $30 and a fancy T-Fal one is $50... but leaving it day after day to annoy your guests... priceless.) Choice of two cold cereals plus packets of maple oatmeal. Three juices, three jams, fruit salad, coffee, tea, muffins, danish and the like. There is an upsell to a full breakfast for an extra $5 per person (plus tax).",3,negative

The room also felt very, very big and we had a good amount of furniture in the room as well.     CONS  pool was freezing. absolutely freezinggg.  tv was pointless. took pretty much 1 minute to change a chanel, get picture, get sounds, realize you cant understand it then repeat. There are only 2 channels worth watching and you have to go threw about 40 channels to find just those 2. I understand that you want people to buy movies but the tv is totally useless stop being cheap.    the mirror above the jazzucci has a picture of a roman soldier WHYYYYY makes the mirror pointless, AND the mirror was not clean.  Breakfast was g a r b a g e . you have to pay 5$ for 2$ worth of food which i didnt even finish because it was inedible , (dont order sunny side up please )       so yea, clean, looks highend and the king size bed jaccuzzi room was really nice,i would deffinatly go back to the same room(alexandria suite) and just plan on not leaving lol.  tv sucks maybe bring your own netflix box it looks easy enough to connedct it to.

363053172,markham\ca\181720\2277075\363053172.html,Monte Carlo Inn &amp; Suites Downtown Markham,"I booked 3 rooms as some members of our extended family was staying there to attend a family funeral. The hotel looks very nice and certainly it is very pleasant for its scale and rates. Apart from some bits to comment on, everything is expected for this accommodation.   Things to note: i) The hotel is in the suburbs, so it would not be fair to talk about transportation or accessibility. The hotel has a nice carpark. ii) The inclusive breakfast is a bit of a shame. Expect it to be the equivalent of a B&B in England (Toast and Jam). Otherwise, there is the option to pay $5 for a ""better"" breakfast. On the whole I would say forget about breakfast, there are other options outside.  The Good: a) Hotel is descent and clean. b) While it is located in the suburbs, there's a nice food mall within walkable distance. c) The rooms are big.  Things that needs to be worked on:  1) Internal communication needs to be worked on. I e-mailed in 2 days before more checkin to arrange a rollaway bed for one of the rooms. While I got a reply from hotel management, I can only say I am very surprised and amazed that reception knows nothing about it.  2)The toilet in one of the room is broken and needs to be repaired the next day. The hotel needs some patching up as it starts to show her age.   3) There are no water kettle in the room. While I do drink from the tap, it is nice to get some hot water for drinks.",3,negative

It is also a very badly laid out hotel, the reception desk is at the opisit side of the hotel to where you arrive, therefore there is no one to great you or no signs to show you where to go. Don't believe what they have posted about what amenities you will have in your room. They advertise it as a suite hotel but what you get is just a regular hotel room/bathroom.

I addressed my concerns directly with the manager who has assured a better stay next time. Booked the Queen Studio with Sofa bed directly on hotel website, was travelling with extended family member so this gave us each a bit of privacy. The room was dark and sofa bed was a twin and ""well used"". My 20 year old sofa bed is more comfortable! Room was on the 3rd floor at the elevator. First night was great. Second night the banquet hall a/c system ran with a constant humming sound, realized in the morning the unit is on the roof of the banquet hall outside the window. Third night there was a function in the banquet hall and the music could be heard in the room. Being so close to the elevator was a negative, could hear people talking in the hallways late at night. My PREFERENCE is for rooms on the 4th or 5th floor, at the end of the hallways, facing the parking lot. As for the breakfast, it was a long weekend and even though we were there early there was a limited selection. The hotel manager has graciously addressed these concerns with the restaurant.

Not just any Riviera but one with a poorly laid out floor plan, a tiny window, rust coming out of the hot tub pipe, paint peeling on the ceiling of the shower, mold in the washroom, holes in the washroom wall. The pool had been great in 2015. This year it was closed one day due to chlorine issues. The next two times we used it, it hadn't been cleaned. The pool opens at 8am and at 9am the pool deck was dirty and there were no clean towels. The fire alarm went off one day and NO staff said anything. We fled the building, following the fire plan and walked past the front desk where one person had her head down and the other was on her device. The alarm stopped after 20 minutes with about a dozen hotel guests standing outside. We opened the door, walked back in, no one at the front desk even acknowledged we were there. No apology, no sorry about the fire alarm. The service is so bad we cannot recommend this hotel to anyone ever again. A complete disaster and you will be better off paying $79 at a Super 8.

415118574,markham\ca\181720\2277075\415118574.html,Monte Carlo Inn &amp; Suites Downtown Markham,First impression was that it was nice and clean room although a very strong cleaner or air freshener is used which is not great if you are bothered by strong scents. Ordered from the restaurant for first nights dinner. Told 10-15 minutes and it arrived 45 minutes later. Food was good but the kids ordered grilled cheese and I ordered a burger and there were no condiments. I literally received a bun with a hamburger patty and that was it. We went for a walk to the restaurant to get these as I didn't want to wait forever to get them. Nice and quiet first night. Continental breakfast comparable to most other hotels. The second night (saturday) we arrived back at the hotel around 10 with 2 very tired kids and as soon as we got out of our car in the parking lot we could hear music playing loudly (lots of bass) from inside the hotel. Once we were inside we realized there was a wedding. Our room was on the 3rd floor and the music was easily heard and felt from our room. The kids and I had a difficult time falling asleep and remained lying awake in our beds until it shut off around 1230. Finally fell asleep shortly after that only to be awaken multiple times for the rest of the night by loud conversations in the hallway. The last time was around 5:45. I didn't bother calling the desk for the music because it was a wedding not a noisy neighbor and they were fully booked so a room change wouldn't have been possible. Most hotels have the noisy hallway issue so I ignored that as well.  Pool is in a room with wall length windows by the front desk so if you wanted to swim you were in full view of everyone coming and going which I found wierd. Husband said the gym was missing the benches rendering some of their equipment useless but he made due. All in all it was a nice hotel with clean rooms and great rates but if I were to book again I would want a guarantee that there were no events that weekend and if there was that we would be in a room that wouldn't be able to hear it.,3,negative

The stay was quite pleasant. The rooms were very clean, big and comfortable and the free WiFi is always a good thing! The beds were really comfortable which you don't often get in hotels.  A couple of issues that did come up: 1) The showers aren't very powerful. By no means are they unusable but if you're used to a power-shower you may be disappointed. 2) The cleaners come to the rooms quite early so make sure you get the ""Do not disturb"" sign on the other side of the door (although even this didn't stop them on one occasion). 3) The breakfast is really disappointing. If you're used to a normal continental breakfast don't expect anything similar. There is a Starbucks within a 10 minute walk which we went to pretty much every day. If the hotel offered a lower rate without breakfast I would have taken it.  Overall a decent stay and if I were to be in the area again I would stay again - . Would happily recommend it.",4,positive

It is removed from all major attractions, and you will definitely need a car, plus you'll get to spend some time in traffic jams trying to go back to the hotel. There is not much happening in the area either.   The entrance is a bit confusing, as the entrance overlooking the main street is closed, you will have to drive around at the back road to get to the parking area and the actual entrance.  If you are on a business trip, and will have something to do in Markham area, I will recommend the hotel. The room: I was in one-bedroom suite with a fireplace, refrigerator, microwave, and a coffeemaker. The room was nice, mind though that they do not have any door latch on your room door. I was getting out of the bathroom, and somebody, I believe some personnel was opening the door at the very moment, thanks God I had a chair pulled to the entrance door, and that stopped the door from getting wide open. I did not feel comfortable sleeping with no bolt or latch on the door.   The breakfast was free, and very basic.   It is ok for a business traveler on a short trip to the Markham area.

Biggest disappointment was the nightly snack. Out of 4 nights (Mon to Thurs when it is offered) only Wed (BBQ night) was OK with burgers and hot dogs. Food at other nights was terrible.

Breakfast was varied and they ensured that the food didn't run out as in some other hotel breakfast rooms. They offered real dishes as well as the plastic/paper variety, and the coffee was decent.

Full size kitchen, sitting area with couch and chair, desk, bed area off to the side. A bar with 2 stools can be used to sit at and eat meals. Room was sparkling clean. Internet access was free - not wireless but they do provide a cable in each room free of charge.  Pool area average. Was almost always someone in there, but it was adequate. The first night we went down to the pool and they must have just treated the hot tub with chemicals because it made our eyes burn. I didn't like the flooring in the pool area - hurt my feet. My partner loved it though, so to each his own I guess.  They have an evening reception during the week with a different food item each night such as sandwiches, falafel, bbq etc. We didn't make it back in time for it but it would be a great cost saving not having to eat out.  Buffet breakfast was also included and had a huge variety of hot and cold items and was very good - no complaints at all there.  Location good depending on your needs - just west of the 404 and just south of 7.

Next time I'll stay at another hotel in the area or at a Marriott further away. I've stayed at many other Marriott hotels, including 2 other Residence Inn's. First of all the hotel does not have King size beds. Second, the queen bed that we had was very uncomfortable. It felt like the springs were poking me. Third, the room was not very clean, and the carpet had stains on it. Something that I have never seen at other Marriotts I have stayed at. The mirrors were dirty, and had sticky liquid stains at the top, the floors were not very clean. Finally, the decor was very dated. I've been to other Marriotts and other hotels that cost the same and there is no comparison. I paid over $140 plus taxes, but the condition of this room did not justify the cost. Finally, the breakfast area is too small and the choices were somewhat limited compared to other Residence Inn's I have stayed at. I can't believe that this hotel is a Residence Inn.

Interesting enough, even it says it is in markham, I feel its location is more like Richmond. henc eit is located north of greater Toronto rather than to the north east.   Access: It is located right off the highway exit; thus its access is very simple and quick.  Pool: A standard small indoor retangular pool. I would not fancy to stay in this hotel for the pool.   Check-In: It was simple and straight forward. Since we booked the room using a certificate, we originally expected a bit of hassle checking in. However, it was smooth and simple. We were quite happy with it.   Staff: This Residence Inn seems to operate with Majority Cantonese staff and some Philipinos. The front receptionist speak very well English but not all their staffs can speak well English. It did not bother me but it would be nicer so that I can chat with the staff when I sit down and eat. It is just my way to getting to know local area better and learning how to get around quickly.   Room: Very well layed out. We had a living, dining and kitchen area. Overall area is small but very efficiently set up. It showes that they have renovated the whole place in side out. Bathroom is renovated and vanity counter is granite. However, it is a pitty that they kept the original bathroom vanity cabinets. It would have been a more complete upgrade and renovation if they have changed the old worn cabinet as well. One thing to mention is that there are plenty of closet space inside the bedroom but there re no storage space in the living area. So it may not be very convenient for those who also wish to use the livingroom sofa bed as a sleeping quarter as well.   Parking: I throught they have done a smart design in parking space layout. Our room was away from the main desk. But our room is 30 sec walk away from a side door that leads to parking lot.   Overall: Marriot courtyard is right next door. But for price, amenities nd value, I think Residence Inn is better for families and couples who travel on a budget.",4,positive

The sitting area is a nice touch with a cool long sofa that fit for that extra person. This is a good place for that short term business stay as this hotel is located at nearby office buildings. What I didn't like about the room was that lingering cooking/food smell coming from the kitchenette, which is common in staying with rooms with a kitchenette.  Stay comes with free breakfast, from 7-10. There is also free wifi. There a pitcher of ice water and coffee station in the lobby area. There is an indoor pool, and tennis court on site.

I can confirm what a number of previous reviewers wrote; here are my highlights:  Pros:  - Close proximity to some corporate offices, shopping, and restaurants (particularly Asian cuisine).  - Older hotel that has new light fixtures, sofas, 32"" LCD TVs, linens, carpets, bar chairs, and wheeled chairs (at the desks).  - Nice-sized pool (with small) \exercise room on the main floor for this class of hotel.  - Indeed, those who love tennis will appreciate the court at the front.  - 10Mbs wired and wireless internet access everywhere.  - Openable windows in each room (but can only be opened a couple of inches each).  - Low price is always nice.  Opportunities for improvement:  - It is an older hotel where the desk, washrooms, and kitchenettes are starting to show their age.  - Service is provided primarily by folks of Asian descent, some of whom are great, some of whom may need more to time to adjust to North American culture and service expectations.  - The queen-sized mattress is my particular room had sags on two sides of the bed which led to less-than-ideal sleep conditions and sore backs.  Overall, I would have rated the hotel 3.5 out of 5 if I could - the hotel is decent and would do in a pinch. Those frequenting the Marriott brand of hotels can expect this property to be a remodeled old version of the Residence Inns. I did not hear any of the small planes above the hotel; however, I would recommend a quick search and review of other hotels in the area before choosing this property.",4,positive

While this is not a 5 or 6-star hotel, this place is certainly a home away from home. My sister asked for an upgrade prior to arrival, and we were given an upgrade as said would. Everything was neat and clean. Our visitors could not believe that there were 3 workable flat screen TVs to entertain us. (We stayed in a 2-bed suite) The kitchen was quite well stocked with cooking utensils. The dishwasher had a good workover anyway.   The breakfast was not as well stocked when compared to others. The kitchen staff could do with a little smile. Alternatively, if they had no inclination to, they can very well stay in the kitchen, and just wait for the dirty plates to come in.   Yes, it is way out of Toronto CBD, but it is exactly of what we were looking for.",4,positive

What's extra nice is that Internet and a hot breakfast are free, which most higher end Marriott hotels do not offer. There is also a large workdesk and flatscreen TV that swivels to the bedroom area and towards the living area when needed.  We gave the location high marks for a place like Markham (suburb of Toronto, about 30 minutes north), where you basically need a car to get anywhere. It is pretty commercial around the hotel, however, there is a small shopping strip about a 3 minute walk from the hotel that has several restaurants in it, including a great Indian place, burger joint, Asian tea house and other a few other restaurants. Also, if you work for any of the office buildings on Commerce Valley Dr., you can walk to work and parking is free there anyway. I would recommend this as a great business hotel.",4,positive

We had stayed at Residence Inns in other cities before and are always happy with the facilities. The Customer service was pleasant and helpful. They had no problem reversing the movie charge on my bill when we told them that my mother had accidentally pressed the wrong button and went to the pay movie channel without knowing it (my mother understands very little English). Also, I requested for a suite with wheelchair access and had no problem getting it. The walk-in shower is really important for my mother, who otherwise, would have great difficulty going in and out of a regular bath tub. The breakfast was good and had good choices. The only not so positive comment I have is the hotel looks tired and needs renovation.",4,positive

I booked a one bedroom suite and was upgraded at check-in to a 2 bedroom!! The room was huge and very clean, with a full kitchen, 3 tvs, 2 bathrooms and very comfortable beds. The pool area was clean and warm and there were plenty of towels available. Complimentary coffee all day/evening and free (full) breakfast were added bonuses.

I didn't do much cooking but if i was staying longer, I would need to and I felt there could have probably been an oven or toaster oven. There was a microwave and a small electric stove. The temperature can be adjusted for each room and facilities are clean. Lots of towels to use and enough toiletries.   STAFF: Very helpful   LOCATION: Not much activities around. The grocery and malls are far and you usually need to take a bus to reach there. In my case I was close to work so that was okay for me.   BREAKFAST: Buffet style: Fruits, cereals, juice, milk, hot drinks, pancakes, waffles, eggs, rolls etc.   POOLS AND GYM: The pool is small and the gym is small. Not much people use it, so that shouldn't be much of a problem.   I enjoyed my stay here more than i did at the Courtyard Marriott next door. This was mainly due to the rooms being more spacious and not feeling boxed up in a hotel room.   I hope my review was helpful
 
 
 Room Tip:  If you don't like to walk, or you are always in a rush, get one close to the elevator.

119005243,markham\ca\181720\236399\119005243.html,Residence Inn Toronto Markham,"Just returned from another Toronto visit, and tried the Residence Inn, sister property to the Courtyard I've stayed at before. The Residence Inn is obviously newer than the Courtyard, and is a much more pleasant stay (though the Courtyard's lobby remodel is finished). The room was well appointed, though not a complete kitchen (no oven or toaster) like some other examples. Linens and bedding was in good shape and overall, pretty clean (though the kitchen counter has seen some hard use that needs attention). The breakfast was adequate, but certainly not worth pushing through the crowds. The eating area is limited, and since the hotel was sold out, many people just took food to their rooms. My problem was that the air conditioning went out on my last night there and apparently there was no one from maintenance to fix it, except by phone. I have to commend the night manager for all his efforts to come up with a solution, but not happy that there was no remedy to the solution and no offer to compensate me for the four hours I had to wait for the resolution that never came. These are the kinds of things that happen in the hotel business and you would think they would have a plan to deal with it. I wouldn't tell anyone to avoid the Residence Inn, but I'm not terribly enthusiastic about going back.

Separate bedroom and large living room with good desk and exec chair made working in the room easier. So often hotels provide token working environs (the desk too high; chair uncomfortable; poor lighting). Small kitchenette with fridge/freezer and dishwasher let me do a little 'home cooking' and the grocery service meant you didn't have to cab to the supermarket. Washing machines & dryers on another floor and would prefer swipe card or tokens as didn't always have a dollar and 2 quarters on me. Breakfast offering limited but covered all bases - cold, hot, healthy.   A toaster and a kettle / hot water jub rather than a coffee maker would be a good idea as would some thing to play your MP3 player through speakers.  Only real downside was they changed the bedside clock radios halfway through my visit and the new ones have a glaring night light that cannot be turned off. Ended up taking the plug out of the wall to get rid of the annoying light.  Not as classy as the Sheraton where we usually stay but for a lengthy stay it was a great place to be.

When we first walked in, the lobbly looked so amazing! So posh and modern looking. They had small booths and tables around for guest to use. A few internet computers which I saw a few kids were taking advantage of. And even a small little kitchenette with snacks and drinks for guests to buy, and a microwave to use.   Our room was spacious and clean, absolutely no complaints about that.  However I do have one complaint. On the Saturday of the wedding I was waiting in the lobby for my ride to the wedding (my husband was part of the bridal party so he left in the limo), and decided to get myself a coffee for the starbucks coffee bar. It didn't look open but I had seen someone behind the counter, so I waited for them to get back. After a few minutes I walked to the front desk (within sight) and asked the lady there if it was open. She said yes and that if I go back and wait someone should come out from the back. After about 5 more minutes I was about to ask again but she was gone from the front desk. No one was around. So I peeked in the back kitchen and immediately a person with a manager badge on asked me sternly ""what are you doing, this is for employees only"". I swear I still had my two feet on the outside of the doorway. I explained that I was told someone would come out soon to serve me. He said that he could.   I then sat there are the bar waiting for him to find the drink mix instructions, find the correct cup size, ingredients. It was a mess. I'm glad he helped me, but it was the worst drink made, incorrectly at that, and he made me pay full price!  Silly complaint I know, but if your coffee bar is open, have someone standing there!",5,positive

The rooms were fine, if on a smaller side, with an odd thing broken here an there (ventilator cover in the bathroom).

The staff proved to be hit and miss, some did not know much about the area, were not able to provide a map of the area, nor cared much, others friendly and polite. Sometime the reception was deserted all together and we had to wait for someone to show up as there is not bell.  After couple of days staying there my key card stopped working, the front desk personnel was not able to explain the reason and I was issued new key card, which proved to not be working either. So after 2 trips back to the reception they sent a repair man with me to make sure the card worked, it did in two thirds of cases and we were promised the issue will be looked at in the morning.

133452948,markham\ca\181720\236399\133452948.html,Residence Inn Toronto Markham,"No question about it, the staff at Residence Inn Markham makes this a 5 star review. I stayed at Residence Inn Markham for 8 weeks during an assignment for work. They have the nice features of any Residence Inn, which include large rooms with a full kitchen (stove, oven, microwave, dishwasher, pots, pans, plates, utensils, etc). They have a complimentary hot breakfast every day with some variety in the food they have each day (so at least it's not the same food every single day). In addition, they have evening food during Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, whether you are looking for a snack or a light dinner.  Now, while there are pros, I do have to mention the cons as well. Sometimes the cleaning of the rooms is not very thorough, such as sometimes, you will see 1 or 2 dirty utensils left from previous guests. With so many things to clean, I understand that sometimes smaller things are missed. Also, the internet connection is usually fast, but sometimes it will slow down to a crawl (like modem speed) for hours at a time. There are a few other things, but are so minor that if you wanted to be nit-picky, the toilet seat does not stay up in many of the rooms, and the room key cards do not work very well on all the doors (as I've gone through many different room key cards over the 8 weeks that I stayed here).  With all of this in mind, I was deciding between a 4 star or 5 star review. To me, a 5 star review usually means that everything in the hotel was absolutely perfect. But back to what I said at the beginning, the staff makes it a 5 star review. The staff at this hotel is the friendliest that I have ever seen at any hotel by far. They are always cheerful, and I'm not talking about just the front desk, but even housekeeping is very nice and polite. The front desk staff does more than just check you in and out of the rooms; they will have conversations with you about how your day was, and make sure that everything is going well for you in the hotel. The staff are genuinely caring. Again, I've stayed at many hotels, but by far the staff are the nicest in Residence Inn Markham. If I were in the Toronto area again, whether for business or pleasure, I would definitely stay at Residence Inn Markham again.

There are at least a half dozen excellent restaurants within walking distance.  The rooms are nice enough - but compared to many Marriott properties I've stayed at in the US, this one is just a little dated in terms of room furnishings, etc.  They offer a free breakfast. As free breakfasts go, this one is excellent. Eggs that actually look like and taste like eggs and a wide assortment of other offerings (fruit, oatmeal, cereals). For hotel coffee, the coffee they serve is quite good as well.  The fitness room is a chamber of horrors -- ancient equipment and not in good repair. They have these TV stands to watch while on a treadmill or elliptical. All but one is broken -- yet they remain in the room.  A trade-off on the great location is noise -- there is a lot more going on in this neighborhood and you may hear some truck noise in the mornings.  Service is good - the staff have been helpful the few times I've needed any assistance. The breakfast crew put out a great spread and have a well-run kitchen/dining room.  This is a long-term stay location. The rooms are equipped for cooking, etc. I don't do this -- but some people do this regularly, which is good for them, but sometimes can put unusual smells in the hallway. Some better ventilation might help. Maybe it is as simple as guests making use of exhaust fans.   Overall this is a very adequate business hotel -- if they did even a few small upgrades (get their fitness room in order) I think they could make this place a clear choice over alternatives like the nearby Hilton Garden Inn, Homewood Suites, etc.",4,positive

The rooms are big, I love the fact that a full kitchenette is incluced in many of the rooms, some just may not have an oven, albeit aside from that, not much required to eat, aside from your groceries. Having said that, the breakfast buffet is awesome, and from Monday to Wednesdays, in the evening, small snacks are provided, just recently including wine. Some nights it may be enough for your dinner.   The beds are very confortable and rooms always cleaned properly. I usually stay in the studio or one bedroom. One bedroom comes in handy when you bring your family as each room is equipped with a TV.  The staff have been very consistent over the years and of course I have my favourites. These individuals go over and beyond what I would expect to receive. This last stay, I was recovering from a procedure and Sandra (front desk) made a gracious point to bring me some breakfast. I was delighted to see such a kind gesture, as I had made no request prior. There is David, whom I understand is now gone, Marie whom cleans the rooms I am usually in, and Heidi in the office. The cook staff are great as well, if you need something extra, or even if they are not open they certainly will accomodate you. My favourite is the cookies in the evening. mmmm.   Aone limo service is awesome, again a company that goes over and beyond just pick up and drop off. Kudos there as well.

Erlinda, who was prepping the evening snack on this day we stayed 8/12/13, added one circle to this hotel by providing pleasant and professional service. Maybe the general manager finds the best worker or he/she trains their workers with a heart, Erlinda is the dream employee any boss can only hope to have. She greeted us with smile, chatted with my young children and bid us farewell by saying ""thank you for staying at Residence Inn"". My children will grow up to be Marriott guests after this stay. And by the way, I am writing this review at Courtyard in Niagara Falls, Ontario.

We chose this hotel because the room was a suite with a totally separate bedroom. We are a family of three with a small child and this was important to us. The room was clean and kitchenette was full of necessities. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They greeted us every time we came and went. We had family members staying next door at the Courtyard because they didn’t need a suite so it was very convenient for us to get together.  The Cons – The bedroom was very small. There was no place to put our luggage. We could empty only one suitcase into the dresser and closet provided, but for a family traveling together, it was not enough. Elevators were very slow! Breakfast room was small and often crowded.   That being said, the cons were only minor to us and it would not stop us from considering this hotel again in the future.",4,positive
176079353,markham\ca\181720\236399\176079353.html,Residence Inn Toronto Markham,"We stayed at this hotel for quite a few weeks this summer ('13) and overall found the facility more than acceptable. Staff were friendly, accommodating and efficient (one staff member could use a little refresher on phone communication - they were a bit blunt, but face-to-face communication was just fine). I can advise, however, not to book a 1 bedroom over a studio.... unless you need the privacy of a door to your bedroom, you will actually lose 4-5 sq. feet, as well as having a shorter table to eat at and no oven. The trade-off of less space and not being able to be more creative at dinner time, was that you get an extra TV. Having 2-burners and a microwave will probably satisfy most, but for longer visits, it just isn't enough. I wish they had told me before we moved from a studio. We thought we would be getting a bigger room (you would think paying more gives you more all around). The fitness center is just a bike, stair-climber, treadmill, one set of 10 lb weights (there is some sort of contraption which are supposed to be weights, but no one could figure it out) and a bench. Enough to do the most basic workout. The pool is indoor and we found it mostly not to be busy with kids, etc. at all. Right across the 2-row parking lot is another Marriot brand, the newer Courtyard, so this makes it a nice little complex. You have the option of going over there to the bar/café without having to get in a car. We also enjoyed taking walks in the evening there - plenty of green to be seen and outdoor seating too. The location is quiet which is difficult to believe when it is one block south of Hwy 7 - a very, very busy business route but that also means a huge selection of shops, groceries and restaurants / tea rooms within 5 minutes of the hotel. I should mention, that the area leans toward Japanese / Chinese / Vietnamese / Korean / Indian. So while you have the standard Western grocery and shopping readily available, you also have the lovely added benefit of exploring other cultures. Bubble tea was a first for us and thoroughly enjoyed it. As well as visiting the not far away Pacifica Mall - I felt like I was back visiting Singapore with all the shops under one roof and the grocery provided the freshest fish around, including live lobster for $5/lb! For our son, who at 13 hasn't traveled outside of N. America beyond Europe yet, it was a fascinating introduction to a new culture. But I diverge.... the only complaint on the rooms other than noted above, is that our room had burnt countertops and the clothes closet mirrored doors had to be held at both ends to close it properly or the opposite end opened up again. I would definitely stay here again (pets are welcomed too) and as I always try to leave a place better or at least the same as I found it (I even remove the sheets and cases from the bed to help housekeeping), I hope my complaints won't make their management too upset, especially as I rate the overall experience a ""thumbs up""!

It is a typical Residence Inn with good standard amenities. I had room 504 on the top floor and found it very quiet. Wifi connections were very good and the bed very nice to sell in.  The only issue was an accidental miscommunication between hotel staff where my room was confused with another room with early checkout. My stuff was cleared out briefly but once the error was discovered, all was put back. This is the first time this has ever happened to me in decades of hotel stays. However, it was all sorted out and notes which were thrown away by the housekeeping staff were recovered safely from the trash by Ruby, one of the front desk staff.  I would recommend the hotel, just be sure to have an accurate set of directions from Toronto airport since heavy traffic and signage may prove an impact.

I can't remember much about the breakfast, but there was a pretty nice and generous spread of the standard fare.

I was in a suite with kitchenette on the 5th floor in the corner. One issue to note is the wind noise..... You hear a constant howl which was quite annoying, not the fault of the hotel or staff. Maybe just as for a middle room. Room were clean and tidy, will soon be in the need for updating though purely cosmetic. They had free breakfast though having to leave at 6am I could not take advantage. They offered free coffee 24/7 which was a bonus. No need to make it in the room or drive out for the java urge. 70/30 as to whether I would stay here again. Not the fault of staff or service, rather there are other places within close proximity with some better amenities and newer all around. Free parking was a good bonus!

The dishwasher is ready to go to a museum (where it actually would not matter that it leaks...).

With priceline you get the studio suite where the bedroom is not in a separate room from the kitchen and sitting area.  Room Very clean and comfortable with a king sized(?) bed and sleeper sofa. The sleeper sofa is not overly comfortable, so if your party needs separate sleeping arrangements for long periods of time it might not be a great room for your needs.

I will list the pros and cons below: Pros: Free parking, free Wi-Fi, free breakfast (which was just ok), Pool and hot tub, workout room (small), refrigerator microwave plates and so forth in our room, laundry room to do your laundry ($1.50 per load and another $1.50 to dry - both go for a half hour each), a small basketball court / tennis court, and number one on the pros list is the front desk staff. They were exceptional! Haslin was more than friendly and even help us with currency exchange. He also gave us a tip to take the subway to see the CN town, which we loved.  Cons: Breakfast waitress staff (seemed rather rude every morning and didn't want to be bothered), the bed (was too firm for our liking, but others may enjoy it), and the towels (they were ultra scratchy). One morning we went to the pool and there were no towels available, but that can be overlooked.  And there you have it - for the price, you really can't go wrong (we got our reservation from Priceline). The rooms are nice and the front desk staff really makes you feel at home. It was a good hotel to stay at if you want to be in between Toronto and the Toronto zoo. There are places to eat around the hotel, but you'll need a vehicle, as the walk could be a bit far. Also, I was skeptical reading some of these reviews, but the hotel didn't disappoint. It does need some updating, but it's not horrible. One last tip: if you decide to go to the CN tower or downtown Toronto, drive to the Finch Street subway station and park in their lot (weekends are free!). For $3 each way, you can go all the way there. CN tower will be the Union station stop - and its a few blocks after that.  Hope this helps you. =)

This one did not disappoint. The front desk staff was exceptional, as well as the managers and the staff that cleaned our room. The pool and hot tub is excellent and often empty, so we could have it to ourselves. The price of the hotel includes a complimentary breakfast as well as a light dinner, three days a week (Mon-Wed). On check out we were rushing to our next destination and in my rush, I forgot a small jewelry box with a bracelet and three pairs of earrings. The cleaning staff found the box and turned it into the front desk. The manager sent the box back to me. I was over the moon. If you want to go downtown to do the Hockey Hall of Fame, Centre Island or anything else downtown, do not drive. Especially not this summer as all of downtown Toronto is under construction and many roads are closed. Go to a park and ride like the one at Finch Street and take the Subway downtown.",5,positive
222021714,markham\ca\181720\236399\222021714.html,Residence Inn Toronto Markham,"As a long long time Marriott platinum member, the Residence brand is my favorite, until this stay. When we checked in on Sunday, we were assured an upgrade was not available because the hotel was fully booked. OK, a one bedroom at a Residence is not a bad place to stay. Until we got in the room and opened the curtains. Nice view!! The view of the roof and a trashed broken screen. The issues continued…  · 1. We were right next to the laundry room. Sitting at the desk trying to work at 9 PM at night, and listening to the banging of an unbalanced washer.   · 2. Giving a webex presentation the next morning, the housekeeper across the hall continuously let the door bang on the stopper as she went in and out – the walls here are not that thick!  · 3. This is not the typical Marriot bed – I woke up with a sore back after tossing and turning all night on an old, thin mattress. It’s not even a queen size, let alone a king size, it’s more like a full/double old bed. It doesn’t even have a typical Marriott duvet on the bed.  · 4. The air conditioning fan is SOOO loud! I tried turning it off but then woke up sweating as the room rose to 75 degrees – tried opening a window but it was stuck.  · 5. The sofas are old and sagging – can’t even sit on one without a pillow.   Bad experience at this property. The Customer Care manager, on our last night, offered us a two bedroom!! There was no way we were packing up and moving, just for one night.

The hotel is conveniently located next to major interactions, with many dining options nearby. The neighborhood area is very nice. Our room was clean and fairly well maintained. The staff, led by shift manager Tom Tran, was friendly and helpful.  My major complaints with Residence Inns in general (not just this one) is the quality of the sofa bed; it is virtually impossible to sleep on it as your back will have a close encounter with the metal springs. After a few nights sleeping on the pull-out sofa bed as well as the sofa itself (without pulling out the bed), I was exhausted. I stayed in a Diamond Resort property in Florida early this year and they had much better sofa be mattress, which felt pretty much the same as regular bed mattress. Marriott should be able to do the same. This specific location has a very small breakfast area and the taste of the food was not on par with other Residence Inns for some reason. I wish the coffee remained in the lobby area after the breakfast was over, but only iced water was left. Despite minor issues we had a good time and would definitely stay here again. The Marriott Courtyard next door also looked very nice.",4,positive

I had one great stay and then the second time I stayed there, my room door was left open by the cleaning crew. I had to have the front desk check my room that no one was in my room and nothing luckily was stolen. Management went out of their way to make it up to me but it still happened so beware. My last stay, someone who had access to my room used my hair brush. My brush was full of hair that was very different from mine. This time the front desk person who helped me the last time I was there and my door was left open, took some hair from my brush and left it on management's desk. Management said they retrained staff and they wanted to buy me a new hair brush. A brush is a brush but this still happened.....beware. I have travelled all over the world for many years and this is the worst two experiences I have ever had at a hotel property. I will not go back.

Right from the moment we walked in and was greeted by the front desk (Dasun I think) I just knew we booked the right hotel as I was ""ify"" as I had made a call earlier that week which did leave a very good taste in my mouth..... BUT.... with that being said, Dasun was amazing. Check-in took just minutes, he offered the girls treats to take up to the room, booked us in the two bed room suite which was AMAZING and the girls went wild........ It was my daughters 10th birthday party so they even sent up a gift basket with all sorts of treats for the girls. We had to call down on two separate occasions just for extra blankets and the girls had just loved one the treats called ""Snapea Crisps"" and had asked if they could have more for their bedtime snack.... Both times ""Cathy"" at the front desk was more than helpful and things were brought up to the room within minutes......  The breakfast the next morning was great.... kids were full...... it was busy but they did a great job at keeping up with keeping the food trays full and cleaning at the same time..... I will definitely book this hotel again and my friend that was with me works with a high profile company in Marketing and now has this hotel in her phone and will recommend any time she can because of the service that we had received from these two incredible individuals :)  If you stay here you will NOT be disappointed and the management team at this hotel should be so very proud of the staff they have working your front desk.

I was able to check into my room with no issue, however after I left my room to have dinner, upon returning I attempted to enter my room to no avail; the maintenance person even had to try my key card several times - this would repeat itself numerous times during my stay.  At the Inn, along with the business travelers, was a sports team with the worst manners in the world; they were loud, rude and very impolite. At the Manager’s dinner on Monday and Tuesday evenings, they stood in front of the steam trays, hogging ALL of the food, leaving barely anything for the remaining guests seated in the dining room; at the Wednesday evening’s dinner sponsored by Baton Rouge, when the sports team arrived, they quickly congregated in front of the steam tables, taking ALL of the ribs and chicken onto 3 plates, broke the lemonade dispenser with their horseplay actions – leaving very little (buns and salad) for the remaining guests. It was pretty much similar during the breakfast time, when the breakfast bar was sabotaged as they touched all of the food with their hands, taking items and returning them after they had pawed them. Not a pleasant experience at all - really gross, not to mention an infection control issue as well.  The Inn has been renovated; it appears to be clean, but the room was very dusty. The bed was extremely hard, which made for a poor night’s sleep. For any person as short as me, the kitchen cupboard is poorly planned and inaccessible.  The hot tub in the pool area is a welcomed asset after a long day's drive, but once the jets started, it stirred up a lot of dirty water; not a pleasant experience! Also the steps into the hot tub are very steep, creating a hazard for anyone with knee issues.   I was booked to spend a second week, but I cancelled my stay at the Inn because of the reasons above.",3,negative

However our experience this weekend was unusual. To start off just after we first arrived the fire alarm went off. After spending some time in the Lobby, (my kids and I were the only people that left their rooms) we found out that a sprinkler pipe had burst and we could go back to our rooms. Unfortunately the burst pipe was right outside our room and water was dripping into buckets. We went down to the pool. It was small, but we had it to ourselves the whole weekend. Unfortunately when we went back to our rooms we found out that the leak was not just outside our room but in our washroom as well. I cleaned that up but the maintenance guy came right up to check out the problem and called right down to management to make sure that another room was available if necessary. Then over night someone broke the wall sconce outside our room and there was glass all over the carpet. The front desk was told at 7:45, again at 9:00 and the glass was still there when we came back from breakfast at 10:00. I spoke to management about how this was totally unacceptable, but they were waiting for pictures to be taken for insurance purposes. He agreed that there was should have been a caution sign put up at least. Even though alot of unusual things happened during our stay the Operations Manager went out of his way to make our stay better.",3,negative

If you've read my past reviews you'll be aware of the fact that I have stayed at the Marriott courtyard right next-door once before. I decided to stay at the Residence Inn this time.

A sink, a dishwasher and a full-size refrigerator are all supplied. Naturally there are dishes, pots and pans, and cutlery for your use. It's a cold night… and I just made myself some soup! That's nice…  Beds: very comfortable; I had a great night sleep last night.  Internet: excellent no problems.  Wall plugs: sufficient  Lighting: sufficient  Cupboard space: excellent  Bathroom amenities: towels are plush, thick and thirsty. The soap isn't fancy… but it works.

Free breakfast:  It is included obviously when you book… there's a nice dining area with a TV for those who wish to catch up on the news in the morning.   They have a variety of scrambled type eggs or omelettes typical of hotels, some fresh fruit, buns and muffins.  I believe I saw a waffle maker down there as well today.

The room was very quiet with no highway or traffic noise. The location was near the 407 and 404 so access back on the 407 was quick and easy. In this area there were a large selection of restaurants to chose from. The room is an ideal set up for some on business that would have to stay in the region for a few days.",5,positive

Getting to and from the hotel was relatively easy. Restaurants were not within walking distance, more like a short 5 min drive. Otherwise, the hotel had everything you would expect a Residence Inn to have. The breakfast was as advertised. The fitness center was basic. The play court was in reasonably good shape. The rooms were clean and well appointed. The night food could have been a little more substantial but it was well within what one would expect from a Residence Inn. One small issue...the hotel sits underneath a popular flight path for single engine aircraft, which are constantly flying overhead. This noise was not audible inside the room.

Yet our room was significantly smaller than the others. Our 1 bedroom suite had a 2 cushion couch but the others had 2 cushions plus a long lounge cushion. In room 210, we had 2 chairs between the door and fridge in front of the closet. Yet our room 110, does not have a closet and only has room for 2 pair of shoes between the door and the fridge. When I complained at the front desk, they told me I was wrong that all the 1 bedroom suites are the same size. Wish I had brought a measuring tape! When you open the pullout sofa, you can't get through the room to the bedroom. We had to move the table into the kitchen blocking the dishwasher so we could walk around the end of the bed to the bathroom. For a family of four (2 adults and 2 teens), this is a ridiculously small living space.

It's an older property which shows its age in some areas, like the slow elevators and noisy bathroom fan. However, it is well-kept and the service staff are pleasant and seem to really care about the well-being of its guests. Rooms are spacious and well furnished with a full kitchen and dishes/silverware. The 1 bedroom suite has a real door separating the living area from the bedroom, good for when traveling with family. The complimentary breakfast is comprehensive with eggs, sausage, pancakes, and a good selection of other items, but the buffet area can get a bit congested during the morning rush. Other minor gripes include lack of ESPN on the TV and a small, minimalist fitness room. Overall the Residence Inn is a good choice in the Markham area for the price.",4,positive

The staff members were rude and the service was awful especially at breakfast time! The food was lousy (pan cake was hard) and there was no milk or coffee available. The staff member got mad at my mom for asking a plate or a cup or even to refill missing food during breakfast. She is not coming back there again.

Check in was fast and efficient. The young receptionist was extremely helpful. I booked a queen bed studio and was offered a room on the fifth floor near the end of the corridor. Terrific for a restful and quiet stay. In particular as the East Coast is having this cold snap with temperatures around 0 deg F and some fine snowfall and I intended to stay mostly indoors and work from there. The room was very clean, obviously updated with a small kitchen, new refrigerator and microwave. Everything worked well.  I especially appreciated being able to push the room temperature higher and also the shower water temperature can be very hot with good pressure on the 5th Floor!! These two features are outstanding compared to several of my recent stays in 4 and 4 plus stars hotel in the US side of the border.  Not everything perfect, just minor things, I thought the bath towels felt a bit harder, perhaps over dried, than other similar hotels. The bathroom fan is turned on with the light and is very noisy, such that I only had this light on a couple of time during 3 nights. Breakfast was complimentary and good enough for a 3 day stay. Breakfast queuing is there on Sunday morning after 9am, as the buffet area is small, with just one toaster and one waffle maker. I took breakfast at 7am on the other two days when the restaurant was much quieter.  The location of the hotel is also very good with a large number of restaurants closeby.

Also worth noting is that the front desk will exchange currency (US to Canadian and vice versa) at a reasonable rate with no extra fees.  Probably the biggest complaint would be the quality of the food in the breakfast (included with room charge). While not horrible, it will basically remind you of what food tasted like in the lunchroom at school. The two ladies serving the food were pleasant and hard-working, though.  Also Note: this hotel is located in a suburb north of Toronto. If you plan on going into the city, you will need to give yourself at least 60 minutes to reach your destination.

Later at check out we found that we had been charged an additional $15 for requesting a rollaway bed in the room. We have stayed at literally 50+ Marriott hotels and have never been charged for an extra rollaway bed. When I disputed this they said that this was the policy of this hotel and what they do elsewhere is up to them.

I usually stay at a Residence Inn because I don't like to go out to restaurants all the time. The English language is poor at this hotel as it's mainly spanish and chinese. That's common for the area, but it did make communication difficult at times.  Issues: 1. My first room only had 1 pot in it, no other cooking stuff. When I asked for a pan, they brought me a brand new one. This makes me suspect all the rooms are the same lol.  2. Be VERY weary of staying there on a Friday night. There's a bar nearby that blasts loud music until 2am. I complained, but the hotel said there was nothing they could do as the bar has a noise permit. I tried to change rooms, but they said there was nothing available. I ended up sleeping on the bathroom floor that night. They changed me rooms later in the week.  3. The room did not have any dishclothes or dishtowels. I requested some, but the cleaning lady couldn't understand what I wanted. I was provided with a dishtowel the next day. The day after that, it disappeared. I ended up using the hand towels and face cloths from the bathroom.  4. The breakfast is good with the full assortment of items I would expect from a Residnece Inn. Dinners are ok, but they often run out of food before dinner is over. They're really conservative to make sure everything gets eaten before replacing it.  5. Service isn't the greatest. Again, due to the language barriers, communication can be frustrating and they aren't all that friendly.  Pros: 1. It's fairly rare to find a tennis court at a hotel. This hotel has one and they will also lend you tennis rackets and a ball to play. Part of the tennis court doubles as the basketball court, so only one sport can be played at a time.",3,negative

Bathrooms had a very loud ventilation system also - no taking a soak in the bathtub - One of the ""in"" doors was also not working - apparently workmen had come for the elevator and door - no parts it seemed. Breakfast was very ordinary - not even waffle machine - the staff smiled a lot to try and make up for problems. There is no coffee or tea during the day - this service was stopped for cost - too bad it was a nice gesture especially in the PM. When TV broke, a repairman was quick to visit and fix. Again the staff make up for lots of going on activity. The hotel has absolutely no type of transport or lift - it is in industrial area - quiet but you do need a car - taxi is very expensive - there is a well used swimming poor with lots of kids - definitely not a business type hotel - more of meetings with family, attending weddings etc. Rates are good and cleanliness is excellent.

Had a two bedroom suite, each with its own bathroom, and fully functioning kitchen (which we did not really use). It felt like an apartment ~with its own fireplace~ and it was nice to come back to. The biggest drawback to this property is not having a car (note for next time) and that it does not have a full service catering facility so that if you a) don't have wheels; b) did not eat on the plane; c) are with an elderly person who does not like walking in pouring rain (even with an umbrella offered by the hotel) ~ your options for finding food are confined to the frozen dinners sold at the Inn's little store in the lobby area. Pizza take-out was said to be available, but when I called I was told no delivery would be possible until 5pm. Would love it if there was room service, even if all it offered was some soup and toasted sandwiches. Breakfast in the morning, which is included, is very decent although the cutlery could do with a hand wash, versus using a machine. Other minor beef: if you are not deaf, or going so, you will find the heating unit very noisy. Otherwise, a really neat place to getaway; greatly appreciate the internet service and choice of TV stations, as well as the overall cleanliness of the place.

We got the 2 queen beds and our 3 year old got one all to himself (blocked in by all the extra pillows), and our 8 month old slept nicely in one of their cribs. The room has a small fridge, and we got a microwave on request. We tried out the pool, which was small, and the water was a bit cold, but we can't complain. The only beef we had was that upon check-out, we received an invoice with the bottled water charge on it for 5.95, then a credit saying 5.95. We assumed, that we were charged as soon as we checked in, and creditted when the bottles were still there. However, when we got our VISA bill, the 5.95 charge showed up. We had to call them to get it cleared, but not without some resistance. So make sure you're not charged for their rip off water!",4,positive

We weren't crazy about the fact that there weren't a great deal of decent restaurant options in the area.  The neighborhood was primarily Chinese so if you like Chinese food, you're in luck. If you want variety, it's a bit of a drive to anything else (beyond fast food).  We would probably stay somewhere closer to downtown next time. Traffic was really bad and we spent a lot of time in the car since most of our activities were closer to downtown.",4,positive

I had stayed there a couple of years ago, but had to check out due to internet issues. I note that they have the same provider, but they have obviously updated, which was what I had hoped. The internet this time was just fine. The stay was uneventful, which is actually what you would want in a hotel.   The hotel was pretty much full, I think there was a wedding going on. This seems to go on a lot in this area.  The breakfast was good, so was the service. I so often see the reviews stating ""I wish breakfast was included"". Since I had the room to myself, the cost of breakfast added onto the room was not an issue. The total was LESS than the ""breakfast included"" hotels nearby. I can tell you, the breakfast I had was a lot better than any ""free"" breakfast I've seen. The service at this hotel for breakfast was better than most Courtyards. This is not to say that the service is bad at other Courtyards, but the waitress was more attentive than normal which was great. No waiting for the bill even.  I had a good sleep on the bed. The room had a refrigerator in it, which was nice.  There seem to be a lot of hotels in the area, and I imagine they are mostly fine, but the next time I'm in the area, I'll stay at this hotel again.",4,positive

Loud noise, strange restaurant and unpleasant staff. Bathroom was dirty with hair around the sink, bed sheets were almost see-through and the carpet in the room should have been burned a long time ago. My wife left the property with strange bites on her leg, which we eventually found out were bed bugs. Mentionned it to the staff, I was told clients from Africa who stayed at the hotel last week were to blame for the bed bugs!!! How unprofessional... I thought I was daydreaming. I asked to be moved in another room, I was told the hotel was full (parking lot had half a dozen cars in it). Anyways, left with a very sour taste in my mouth.

Quite large and well furnished with flatscreen TV, large cupboards and a large comfortable bed. The washroom was also quite big and clean.  Overall impression of the hotel was clean, modern and new.

The little Market was always open which was nice.  Check in was easy, the gym and pool were great. I found the lay out of the room strange, the TV was beside the bed so we had to turn the TV and sit sideways to see it.

Speeds were very fast with no slowdowns or lag. Excellent for streaming live video or youtube online.   Our room featured a LCD TV, and not the old fashioned tube tv which I believe is in some of the previous tripadvisor user uploaded photos.

Unfortunately, the front desk agent (Michelle) wasn't too welcoming. We informed her that we booked through Priceline and added the second night for the same rate. She just asked for my ID, credit card, and if 2 cards are okay. She didn't bother to greet us or ask what kind of room we want. Anyways, when she was about to hand us the card, I asked if there's still any room with balcony and there wasn't.   So, here we are at #231. We have a beautiful view of our car in the parking lot. It's the room in the corner, away from the elevator. Very peaceful except for the loud AC (even when it's not in fan-mode). First impression of the room, it's clean and comfy. Bed is good, comforter is very thin but there's lots of pillows! The bedsheets are really soft but you can tell one is whiter than the other. Mirror and sink are outside the bathroom with only one bar of soap (the other one is facial soap). When you're taking shower, you're using the soap in the bathroom. The next time you'll wash your hands, you have to go inside and bring the soap outside. I suggest Marriott to provide two bars of soap.  The layout of the room is a bit awkward. For people who wants to just relax and watch the TV, it might be uncomfortable. The TV is positioned to the right of the bed and yes you can still see it from the sofa bed on an angle. Bed itself is facing the window.   Furniture is good, lamps are working, and the double curtains are great. We can rest at daytime with no sunlight. However, as noted before, we told the front desk agent that we added a second day on our stay. We're about to rest and housekeeping knocked the door. We didn't answer and Marriott still call us to come down anytime and change our card. The front desk agent (a guy- didn't get his name) was very polite and apologetic, though.

The assistant was over at the Bistro buying food, which wasnt a major problem to me. We checked in and headed up the elevator. I might add the lobby is very modern and I love the decor. The carpet on the second floor smelled a little foul, i guess like any hotel does. We enter the room and it was very spacious and we were very satisfied with the size. The downside was the smoke alarm kept beeping intermittently for the first night. We didnt know what it was so left it alone. The Air conditioning/heat was taking no settnings that we input and was working on a mind of its own. The second night, the smoke detector got worst and i called the front desk. A gentleman came up and said he was going to change the battery. He then proceeded to take the chair we had for sitting on in our room, and laid a towel out and stood on it to change the battery in the smoke detector. Now I believe this is totally unacceptable as a maintenance man should walk with a ladder. I then asked him to look at the Air Conditioning control and the gentleman proceeded to go to the Unit. He as a maintenance man should know that the Temperature is controlled by a control on the wall by the bathroom and not the unit itself as the knobs are broken off. I then realized he did not know what he was doing and didnt want him to screw it up, so I asked him to leave. This i would say was my worst experience of the trip. Who would want a maintenance man standing on a chair I sit on in his shoes, even if he laid down a towel or not. UNACCEPTABLE",3,negative

145653791,markham\ca\181720\240643\145653791.html,Courtyard Toronto Markham,"For a hotel in the middle of nowhere, it served its purpose. I was attending a conference across the road at the terrible Sheraton, and as a loyal Marriott member, chose the Courtyard instead.  I was kindly upgraded to a Jacuzzi room, which was nearly identical to the one I had in Orlando, but without the balcony and of course the warm sunshine. The a/c and heating unit worked well and I managed to maintain a constant temperature in my large room. Shower strength was excellent and there was a complimentary bottle of water and snack in my room as a Platinum member. One feature I love in Canadian hotels is the blue recycling bin.  I’m not a huge fan of the Bistro concept now introduced at most Courtyards, but it seemed busy on most nights. I did note a Tim Horton’s a short distance away.  I thought some of the staff at the Courtyard were outstanding but others required a little more training.   The hotel seemed to be popular with sports teams and teenagers on the weekend. Luckily, I was on a quiet floor and slept well.  The hotel is a very expensive cab ride to downtown Toronto, and most of the restaurants within walking distance are Chinese, Indian or of the chain variety, but it provided a safe, clean and comfortable haven from the chaos of a conference. A very solid 3 ½ out of 5 stars.

The staff was professional, courteous, and friendly. For such a young group of people running the place, this was a delightful surprise.  As you walk in, the first thing that I noticed was that the air ventilation was great; not stuffy, and definitely not stinky, so I was happy. Check-in was quick and smooth, and as Marriott Elite members, we got a great room on the 6th floor in the corner.  The hallways were bright and pretty well maintained, and our room was standard and comfortable. Bathroom was immaculate, and everything was in working order. I'm glad that Courtyard has updated their toiletries to be the Paul Mitchell brand, but now, if they could have a better hairdryer that isn't so loud! Oh, and free water would be nice.  Wi-fi was okay, though in the evening, the speed definitely slowed down, but that's to be expected if there is a high volume of people staying here. They do have computers down in the lobby area for your use, and the speed there is definitely faster. Breakfast is a la carte here, and served 7am-10:30am; dinner is 5pm-7pm, but I never choose to eat at hotels when you have so many choices and options for food nearby! For example, if you love Taiwanese/ Northern Chinese style braised beef noodle soup, check out Mei Nung Noodle in the First Markham Place shopping center. In general, there are a ton of choices at that shopping center.  Before coming here, we used to normally stay at the Mississauga location, but after staying here, we think this will probably be our new haunt! Closer to Downtown Toronto (about 15-20 minutes), and away from the highway noise (the Mississauga one was right next to the 401, and if you weren't careful as to which side of the building you were on, you'd definitely hear traffic noise in the evenings). For just $5 CAD more, it's totally worth it!  Free parking, well lit, good staff, comfortable and clean bed. We were happy! Now, if they'd only give free water for everybody and have a microwave, I'd give this place 5 stars!

149326783,markham\ca\181720\240643\149326783.html,Courtyard Toronto Markham,"Spent 1 night here in September 2012 on our way to Quebec. There is nothing super wrong with this hotel, especially as an overnight road trip stop; however, given the wealth of hotels in the area, I imagine that most travelers can do better. The front desk staff was very friendly and accommodating, which is always appreciated. The hallways showed a lot of wear and tear, but the room itself was very clean and appeared to have been recently updated, so perhaps the common areas will soon see a facelift. The theme throughout had a minimalist Asian tone with burnt oranges, umbers, and reds, punctuated by the occasional photograph of a row of rain drops or some other Zen like photograph. The arrangement of the room was unique, with the bed facing the window and the dresser and TV off to the side. Some may not like this arrangement, but I found it refreshing. It seemed to open-up the space. The shower had hot water. The pressure was sufficient but not great. The biggest draw-back, for me, was how crazy expensive the breakfast offerings were. Coffee was gratis, but other than that, a hefty price had to be paid for what items were on their limited menu. I found it amazing that they were charging the prices that they were for basic breakfast items, when so many chain hotels at least offer a continental breakfast, and in many cases much more, for free. The whole breakfast experience made me feel as if I was being taken to the cleaners (unfairly parted with my money, for those who don't understand that American idiom). You will see that I also review another Courtyard Marriott, which was part of this same trip. If I had not already booked this hotel, I would have chosen something different, based on my experience here. If you do stay, I don't think that you will be disappointed with the stay, in general, but plan on eating someplace else and keep in mind that you can probably find better value for the money.",3,negative

We have stayed at the Residence Inn (right behind the Courtyard), the Holiday Inn Hotel and Suites on Woodbine, the Hilton Garden Inn, and the Staybridge Suites before. We loved the artwork on the walls (wished we could have taken it home with us), it had an asian flare and went well with the rest of the decor. The fitness room was nice and there were even headphones to plug into the TV's, which was great since I forgot mine. The location was perfect for what we came to Markham for, To EAT!

I think it is the best of the group of hotels in that category and location - I have stayed at the others.  For me,the one big disppointment this time was the breakfast. In the past, this hotel offered a breakfast that ran ""circles around the competition"" in the area. You were served at your table and could order from an impressive menu, or you could have the choice of the buffet. The place had waiters attending to you.  Now, all that is gone. You have a budget style quick breakfast, maybe find one person that is watching the tables but for the most part, you are on your own. You help yourself to a very poor selection of basics. I wasn't about to go out in the cold and start looking for a decent place for breakfast, so I opted for this poor choice.  Breakfasts in the past, is what placed this hotel above the rest of the bunch. In my opinion it looks like they are cutting costs or maybe there are new owners. Probably, the first place to start cutting is with breakfasts.  Breakfasts can always be eaten off premises so in my view, depending on your needs,it does not have to be a decision maker. If however you are staying there on a business trip or want to invite friends to join you for breakfast, I think that should be taken into consideration. You certainly cannot invite any business clients or friends to have breakfast with you.  In the Courtyard or Garden Inn categories,this hotel still enjoys an excellent reputation and is good value. That said,the breakfast issue has given the place a bit more of a ""budget"" atmosphere.  Rooms were as expected, spotless and clean and the staff at the front desk were very helpful.",3,negative

I stayed for one evening and found the hotel to be generally average.

As such my rate was raised about $10. Not the best start to my trip. I then checked in, dropped my bags off and had dinner at the ""bistro."" It is standard, pre-prepared food common to Courtyards. It is quite acceptable for the price but nothing special. It is better than having to drive around to find somewhere to eat.  The room itself was only okay. The temperature was controlled through an analog rotary dial on the air conditioner/heater. I hadn't seen one of these in a Courtyard in some time. The state of the room was only okay. The shower was falling apart a bit and the room showed it's age but was acceptable.  As mentioned by others, the breakfast is only ok and, frankly, should be free of charge given what other hotels are offering.

It was further afield than ideal, but we'd heard good things and the price was quite reasonable so we took the chance. Plus, it's very easy to get there given it's right off major highways. This is now a favourite place to stay in Toronto! What a pleasant surprise.   We arrived at 2 am and the check in was very easy, with a nice person at the desk. (And the desk was easy to find, as well). Even in our tired state, we noticed that the lobby was very nice, very attractive, and very welcoming. The next day, we were still impressed-- it's not done up as fancy or ""private club"" style like some hotels, but it's comfortable-looking, very modern, with many pods and tables for people to sit (either by themselves or as a family/group of people). It was the sort of space you truly want to hang out in-- and people really were using it, at all hours of the day and night.   The hallways are unusually bright (unlike most dim, dark, dungeon-like corridors), and the rooms are modern and attractive. My husband was thrilled that they had Starbucks coffee in lobby, free from 6-10 am.  All rooms come with a tiny but well laid out mini fridge, and the shower head was fancy and wonderful.   Not everything was ideal. The mattress wasn't that comfortable, but at least it was newish and bug free. The bed topper was super-thin, definitely not warm enough-- husband found a thin blanket in the closet that made it OK.   The ventilation fan was either very quiet or super-loud; the first night, ever time I started to doze off, it would startle me awake. And this was after arriving at 2 am.

I asked the front desk for a room change but they refused and claimed the hotel is fully booked. Granted, it is a holiday, but not busiest season. They blame Priceline for the issue. Well, it turns out it is not strictly true that they do not have rooms available, because they do offer and have double rooms available (but not for the Priceline price we paid for, of course, which I understand).  When I book a room for two adults, I would expect two have two beds available if I ask. That is not an outrageous demand at all, yet Courtyard by Marriott at Toronto Markham refused to accommodate this.

In the past there was a coffee station nearby where we can get free coffee anytime of the day but guess this service was cut off. There is two elevator serving this hotel and one has double doors (front to guest room and rear to staff facility room). Getting into the double door elevator can be confusing a bit on exit door.

217123544,markham\ca\181720\240643\217123544.html,Courtyard Toronto Markham,"Pro: Friendliest front desk staff I have ever met. Bed sheets crisp and clean, room nice, food at bistro was good. So so: We booked our stay, two nights, online and specifically picked a room advertised with the jetted roman tub and balcony. We were given a room without balcony, which the front desk immediately corrected but mentioned that usually you have to book over the phone to make sure you get a balcony. That part didn't really make sense to me: if the description of my room on the Courtyard website says it comes with balcony (as I'm booking it and in the confirmation), it should come with a balcony. Cons:  My husband is a little over 6 feet tall, the toilets are so close to the bathroom door he actually couldn't close the door since his knees were in the way. That in itself isn't a problem, I realize businesses can't be expected to accommodate all sizes of people, however, the inside of the doors were so filthy from other people holding the doors open while using the toilet that it took four wet wipes to clean the general area. Hopefully this is something that has been addressed since we stayed at the hotel August, 2013. The knob on the jetted tub was broken, we called down to let them know but did not want them to send anyone up to fix it that evening. We did expect someone to fix it while we were out all day the next day, but when we came home late the second evening it still wasn't fixed. We specifically booked a room with a roman jetted tub to try it and the different settings out to decide if we wanted to buy one, instead the tub was stuck on one setting. Finally, when we stayed we weren't supposed to use any of our own oils etc. (not sure if that has changed) in the tub but a small packet of bath salts was provided the first night; however, not the second night. In my opinion, if we pay for two nights to stay in a room that comes with bath salts the first night, we should also receive said salts for the second day.",3,negative

We saw a price of $109 online but didn't read all the details as I was looking on my tiny phone. When bf mentioned the price we saw to the Chinese guy at the front desk, after the guy quoted us $120 something for one night and the next day was around $164....he told us to go online and book it if we saw that price. Turns out the price is for the next weekend and it would have been nice if he mentioned that unless he wasn't well up to date with his own hotel special rates. He did not look like he enjoyed his job. This was Sunday July 20th around 1pm. The lady who greeted me was very pleasant....I can't say the same about the guy.

Parking ample if you count both hotels side by side.  Quiet: Yup!  Food: No ""free breakfast"" here (as there is at the Marriott Residence next door), but they DO have a small bistro where you can buy it. Some other goodies as well.  Front Desk Staff: friendly and helpful.  Room: not huge but it sufficed for a couple of days.   Small coffee maker (a cup at a time) and if you hunt, you'll find a small fridge in a cabinet. NO microwave.  Shower: not super-forceful, (but you'll be hard-pressed to find a hotel shower that is), but it's fine. It's a tub by the way, not a walk-in. (I assume that's much better for those who prefer a bath over a shower anyway!)  Towels: Thirsty enough and soft enough.  Plugs: I carry my own power bar (the electrical type not the food type) which WAS needed here to plug stuff in beside the bed. Only a typical 2-socket thing in the wall and of course one is used for the wall-mounted night lamp (no sockets in the lamp).  Price: average for these places.  Guest Laundry: They have one as promised but only one washer and one dryer.   The washer worked but if you prefer your clothes to spin out the excess moisture (I certainly do), then this one didn't! It was quite an experience to have to stand over a washing machine while wringing my socks out! Ha!   Anyway.. the dryer had a great blast of heat and took care of that problem in about 60 mins (rather than 30-ish) and assuming my socks didn't shrink to the size of booties, I'll be satisfied enough. (I told them to fix it btw.) One machine of each however is NOT sufficient for the number of guests who may stay here at one time so be prepared to wait or get the laundry done at 2am.  Air Conditioner: A wall-mount and it was fine.  Bed: Not the ""heavenly"" type but a ""comfy"" type. No problems here at all (see past reviews).  Internet: Fine.  All in all, perfectly fine.

Special thanks to Aimee on our check-in. Will stay again.  Unlike most US hotels, this Courtyard doesn't come with complimentary bf.

On Hwy 7 walk west is Commerce Gate, across Hwy 7 is Time Square & next to it (west) is Jubilee Square.

Given King bed room on 5th floor. Bathroom was kind of small, just toilet and shower with sink external, across from closet/mirror. Flat screen TV, temp controls on actual unit, not on the wall. Sofa bed in room. Fridge in room. Wireless sufficient for our needs. Hot tub was ok, but in need of a cleaning. Pool was kind of cold. Seems some teams were staying, should be more parental supervision, 5 or 6 boys were in the exercise rm, took all the paper cups out of holder and played with them, dropped on floor, etc...then proceeded to put back in holder. Hotel close to many restaurants and shopping. Would recommend and stay again if in the area.

My family was staying at the hotel for a hockey tournament. Unfortunately we spent a lot of time in the room as my daughter was sick but it was spacious and served our needs. What I noticed was the willingness of staff to help guests most notably when I asked if we could cancel the last night registration so we could get my daughter who still wasn't feeling well home. It was done without hesitation with a smile even though it was after the usual departure time.  The hotel provided a great space for team socializing, wonderful breakfast for the families and the floors were very quiet at all times. The only thing I would comment on was the heating system didn't seem to work well (one extreme or another) and the room could have been cleaner upon our arrival as there were hairs in the bed and around the sink that I felt should not have been there if cleaned properly.  The customer service of the staff was great and I would recommend this hotel for business or family stays. Thanks for a great stay despite family illness.

When we arrived in the morning of the 5th of July 2015, the lift was out of service but was working again by the afternoon. This hotel was a great value of money, we would defiantly recommend. The hotel is far from Toronto's main attractions, but they are easily accessible using local bus services that go into town. I advise driving instead of using public transport, it took us almost 2 hours to get to Canada's Wonderland and Down-town Toronto where it would have taken under 30 minutes by car.

Free parking.   Markham is about 20-30 minutes north of downtown Toronto. I prefer staying away from the center of town as the traffic in the DT areas always get to me. This was a perfect choice. It is one freeway exit north of the exit for the new Chinatown in Markham, so there were plenty of places nearby to find a good Chinese dinner. There are also plenty of other dining choices in the immediate area. The entire area of Markham seems to be fairly new and with lots of high tech companies, like IBM, nearby.   Would definitely stay here again on my next trip to Toronto. Friendly staff. Breakfast is $9.95 Canadian, which I didn't have time to indulge in. Got this on a Priceline bid of $35.

There were some complimentary refreshments served in the lobby and the whole team was able to get a slightly later check-out that worked well with the game schedule. Signs were posted on the elevator and the lobby to let us know the breakfast times and service was always attentive. The location is excellent, with over a dozen restaurants within walking distance. Lots of people made use of the fitness facilities and/or the pool/hot tub and the rooms are spacious I highly recommend this hotel for a group stay.

It did seem to cater to sports teams and families and the first night we had parents who had put their younger children to bed and then sat down in the hallway out side their rooms which happened to be next to our room and visited until 11:30 PM which was when I finally called front desk to ask them to please handle it. Just as someone from the front desk came up they went to their rooms but front desk did knock on their door and explain that other guest were complaining about the noise. They checked out the next morning so our next night was quiet and peaceful.

The service was Excellent, Amiee was amazing, she was there day and night and went above and beyond what was required. There was a gentleman working the bar one night and was very unfriendly, not attentive, did not provide little bits and bites that Amiee did but offered us to go purchase some if we wanted.

In fact, the Residence Inn (also by Marriott) is just across from it and shares the parking lot (in fact, not sure why they have both of them so closed together). Fast check-in and check-out. Standard amenities (e.g. Gym and Pool) although I didn't have time to try any of it (although saw a lot of kids having fun at the pool as I walked by). Room is spacious. My room came with a sofa bed which is nice if you have a small group. The decor looks ok... not 5 star for sure but in decent shape. Elevator seems kind of old and slow. The only thing that I didn't really like about this hotel is the price they charged for food/drinks. They have a convenient store like setup around the lobby but somehow the prices weren't really clearly labelled (and for the ones that you can see, it wasn't cheap). They have two bottles of regular water in the room which cost 2.50 each which I think is kind of pricey. If you want food or drinks, would definitely advice you to drive up to Hwy 7 (2 to 5 min drive, traffic light dependent) and grab something from the gas station or coffee shop.

Overall our stay was pretty good with a short drive to great restaurants (Alice Fazooli's, The Keg, Eggsmart and local Chinese restaurants) and the Don Valley Parkway. We choose to pay a little more to book a bigger room with 2 queen beds and a sofa bed for my husband, daughter and my senior dad. The room was clean and spacious located on the 5th floor (total of 6 floors in the facility) with a lovely balcony that faced onto the busy road. We enjoyed watching the activity and could even see the CN Tower from afar. Once the sliding glass doors were closed, you could occasionally hear the traffic. The room contained a fridge, mini coffee maker and a small television. Parking and Wi-Fi were free which was a great plus, and the Wi-Fi speed was very pretty good. The sink was located outside the bathroom, which was great for the family members trying to get ready in the morning/evening. The bathroom itself was quite small, however the shower pressure and temperature was excellent. My husband and daughter really enjoyed the pool and hot tub. Some suggestions I would make to add to the room that I believe would be greatly appreciated are: a small safe for folks to put away their valuables (especially for international visitors), a drying line in the bathroom so we can hang up wet bathing suits and wet towels, and extra drawer space. There were a total of 3 drawers only, thus 1 family member had to live out of their luggage. An extra night table for the other bed would have been a lot more convenient for water, glasses, reading books etc...  The room itself was quiet, and you could not hear the neighbours. The air conditioner was a bit noisy, but we tuned it out quickly. The only unfortunate thing was one of our neighbours were smoking inside their room and it wafted into ours quite often. This was a bit of an annoyance.   We had breakfast on one of the days at the Bistro and the food was good with good portions. We also had coffee (Starbucks) and snacks on occasion, and this pricing was not too high. The Bistro staff were friendly and very helpful.   Staff at the desk were friendly and check in and out was quick. Pool was nice and had towels readily available. The lobby is decorated very nicely and had a big business/docking area.",4,positive

A half filled glass of water left at bed side table was still there the next day after cleanup. Over all, it was a much better property and room than the Quality hotels. A minor minus was shampoo. There was barely enough to wash one person's hair. Though we carry our own most of the time for fear of this. Just at a glance the coffee shop down stairs was tad pricey. Free parking is a bonus. Prepaid thus check in check out was flaw less with good courteous staff. Incidentally the AC can be noisy considering this looked like a new property. The mini bar was cooling items so so. Take your own bottled water. In room bottled water was extremely expensive.

Bathroom vanity is separate from tub/toilet, so somebody can actually use the bath while others are brushing teeth (a convenient feature for our family). There was a wedding rehearsal going on downstairs. They gave soft cookies out at the counter in the late afternoon/early evening. The business center downstairs is nice looking but only good for one person at a time to use the computer. Breakfast sounded expensive so we passed, but if you take it it sounds like they cook omelets and eggs to order on the spot. However they do have free hot tea and coffee in downstairs, which I really appreciated.  Location is near (very near) restaurants (it's practically in a shopping plaza edge) or at the corner of main road there is a huge chinese restaurant/shopping plaza for those seeking chinese food to eat (some of it very affordable). Come to think of it, I barely saw any staff at the hotel counter when I was there, but I saw three chambermaids in the hall. Decor looks kind of asian-motif. (Rugs etc.)",4,positive

The hotel is somewhat older and not fancy at all, but well maintained and clean. The hotel rooms are quite nice and spacious.   All staff I met was very friendly and motivated. When I asked for something which happened a few times they were very reliable and fast to solve it. Housekeeping was very good. I liked their gym and uset it daily. Four cardio machines and free weights.  Breakfast is served in their own Starbucks. This is nice but has the disadvantage that you have to queue in the morning.

342957827,markham\ca\181720\240643\342957827.html,Courtyard Toronto Markham,"Our stay was very short (over a weekend, 2 nights) so for the time we stayed the room was just perfect for us. We were visiting from U.S. and planned on checking out a few tourist attractions while we were there. Our room wasn't huge and it wasn't tiny. The room had a tendency to get really dry though which was a little bit of a problem, but it wasn't a deal breaker. There was a considerable amount of crowd the weekend we were there (hockey tournament?) but the floors with rooms were managed well. From time to time, I could easily hear conversations happening in the hallway (so if you're a light sleeper....) - other visitors or maybe the staff talking amongst themselves, but we weren't bothered greatly by it. However, I'm not sure if this is a usual thing. The beds were comfortable, really warm, and clean. The room was very cozy and we had access to free WiFi and cable. It was nice to have a TV to watch and relax for an hour or two before we went to sleep. There was a crack here and there on the bathroom walls but it wasn't unsanitary or unsightly by any means.  This hotel is right next to Residence Inn, literally right across the parking lot. Our room faced the parking lot and Residence Inn, but even so, privacy wasn't compromised. We still got ample light in the morning.  There are TONS of restaurants right by this hotel! Chinese, Vietnamese, Indian, Spanish, Japanese, Italian, even a Subway, it's all around this hotel. This is definitely one of the perks of staying here.

We arrived late, unpacked and went to lie down for the night- look over and see what looked like vomit on the hotel phone!!!! This was my first discussion with the hotel staff, showing them a photo the next morning of my view from my pillow. There was a very quick- ""we will take care of this"". To me, not really an acceptable response for such a disgusting thing to find in a room (let alone on the phone!!) - next issue- another guest attempted numerous times to reach me by calling room to room. The phone was clearly not working- the front desk was aware as the other party reported this and even tried to go through the front desk to contact me. (I also reported this as I was exiting that afternoon to go out for an event) This was in the middle of the afternoon- hotel did nothing to remedy the situation. We arrive back that evening to large black hand prints in the shower. Not sure what that would have been- but clearly another housekeeping issue. That night I attempted to reach the front desk as at 11:30pm as there were kids running in the halls above us. NO way to contact the front desk as our phone had not been fixed or replaced. Again unacceptable but they did send a staff member up to see what the issue was as they could tell we were trying to call. The hotel staff's response to my noise complaint was ""sorry but there is only one person on duty from 11pm-7am so there won't be much we can do"". Hmmmmmm- you have 7 or 8 hockey teams staying in a hotel and you can not pay an extra employee to staff the hotel appropriately?????? I went to the front desk the next morning to check out and very respectfully and politely reviewed the issues from our stay and requested a refund for one night. Fast forward- 3 calls to Marriott Rewards and numerous emails back and forth with the hotel yields only an offer for more Marriott Rewards points- NOT ACCEPTABLE. The hotel could not deliver the product that I paid for - which was a good night's sleep in a clean room with working amenities such as a phone. Honestly I should have requested a refund for the entire stay! Too bad for Marriott as I will take my loyalty elsewhere to a chain that can respond appropriately and in a timely manner without making the customer continue to call and email to get a satisfactory response.

Check in for each team member was very organized. The staff at front desk had gone to the trouble of looking up where our team's games were and were able to advise us on travel times. The hotel even set up an especially early breakfast for our team to make sure their service wouldn't hold us up. This thoughtfulness was above and beyond my expectations!!! Everyone was pleased with the facility. It was clean and well maintained, with a small pool, hot tub and exercise room. The lobby is a lovely gathering place where guests can socialize, with a bunch of computers, a bar and snack area.  There was excellent service at the front desk and very attentive service in the breakfast area. The fridge in the room was handy. Breakfast had a good variety of choices, including scrambled eggs, sausage and yummy fried potatoes, as well as breads, cereals, fresh whole fruit, juices, etc. - much beyond the regular basic continental breakfast. The only complaint I heard was about the coffee.  We had a standard room with 2 queens which was more spacious than expected. The beds and pillows were comfortable. For those looking for something even more spacious, the hotel has 3 room suites that are lovely for a larger family. This hotel was an excellent value in close proximity (walking distance) to a movie theatre and several dining options, including Jack Astor's, Scaddabush, The Keg and tons of others. The location is convenient, at 404 and 407. Near Markham Towne Centre. We would be happy to stay here again for business or leisure.

It needs a makeover and it seemed to be thrown together from the sixties décor in the rooms to the poor layout cafeteria style restaurant with "" I think can make you feel comfortable"" but it really doesn't hit the mark. Rooms were dated and the food well, I think TV dinner would best describe what they were trying to get at but failed. I really do not like writing a poor review but when you have other choices I think that this hotel needs a serious makeover.

Close to Toronto city, and to shops and food. That's the good part, now the bad. Check in was quick, but didn't really feel welcoming. Later in the evening, we asked the front desk for an extra sheet for my son's crib. Never did come. Asked again the next night, and it was brought up promptly.  The problem with this hotel was the first night, there must have been some sort of party or reception downstairs, because starting around 10 pm, you could hear the thump thump thump of music bass. It was like being in a college dorm and hearing the party going on next door, except we were 5 floors up!!!! It was extremely annoying to us, and we couldn't believe the noise it was making. Thankfully the second night, there was no party, and no music.  Breakfast was part of our package, and we enjoyed a nice hot buffet breakfast both mornings of our stay.   In conclusion, you may want to check to see if there are any parties scheduled for this hotel before you book it, or the music may annoy you as it did us. I can't imagine being on a lower floor closer to the meeting room, it would have been disturbing to say the least. On that fact alone, we probably won't stay here again.

My host's offices were in Markham and this hotel was the first one that popped up on my company travel service. I decided to stay here, and I was glad I did. The friendly staff helped me when I really needed it, and I was pleased with the overall experience.  The hotel is about 20 minutes from the airport. I arrived pretty late at night and some of the road construction barriers on 427 were a little confusing but otherwise it was a pretty straight forward drive. The location is excellent for business travelers to the Markham area.  I arrived at 1:30am in the morning. I had called the hotel twice about my travel delays and sure enough they saved a room for me. It turns out they gave me a super huge double suite. I had an apartment sized kitchen, living room/tv room area. I had a double-doored bedroom with a huge king sized bed and sofa area with a double sink bathroom and a normal toilet/shower area. 2 flatscreen TVs, free wifi and a really good heating/cooling setup. This was way fancier than I paid for.   I was hugely grateful that they still kept a room for me. No doubt all the other rooms had been given away. I am far from a VIP traveler. Thanks!!  The lobby area is in the newly remodeled Courtyard style. A small buffet breakfast is included in my room price with option of ordering a fuller breakfast. There were lots of tables and chairs setup for informal business breakfast meetings. This is normal stuff for Courtyard. This one has been nicely updated (or just new).  There are lots of good business travel hotels in the area. This one was nice, and I'll come back.  Side note: I got total sticker shock on my rental car. I paid over $CDN 215 for less than 24 hours. This was the rate negotiated by my travel service. The rental agent says its supply and demand and hopefully next time it will be cheaper.

It will always be waived.  management then became rude and confrontational. the situation escalated with the manager nearly attacking me and my colleague.

The rate was actually for each night! I spoke to the Hotel manager, even showed her the email confirming the rate, but they didn't change the rate. They were very rude and even added some extra ""gratuities"" charges in my invoice that I never signed for. I left Toronto really mad!!! The hotel was fine, it isn't great, but it is fine. The room was spacious and the jacuzzi was ok. The hotel hallways smelled like curry. It is located a little far from Downtown, but if you are driving it isn't a problem. They have a big parking lot. The hotel restaurant is weak, the food isn't good and the service is bad. I won't go back there for sure. I do not recommend staying at this hotel, good customer service and respect for the clients is essential",2,negative
6150148,markham\ca\181720\248578\11655073.html,Monte Carlo Inns Markham,"We stayed here for two nights on 11/14-11/15. The hotel is surrounded by an industrial park with office buildings and warehouses; however, many restaurants, e.g., Tim Horton's, Swiss Chalet, 3 Indian restaurants, 1 steakhouse, many Oriental restaurants, and stores, e.g., Costco, assorted small stores, are within walking distance or <2 minute driving distance.  The hotel parking lot surrounds the hotel building and it is well-lit and free. I had an unobstructed view of my car from my 3rd story room. The hallways are also well-lit and looked and smelled clean. My 2-queen nonsmoking room was huge and contained a small desk for my laptop. Wireless internet worked, but very slowly (I think it was B and not G). The television picture was clear and the TV had functioning closed-captioning when viewing regular channels; however, the closed-captioning did not work with a movie that I ordered through the hotel channel (not good for hard of hearing people like myself). I slept good enough on the beds. The bathroom was a good size, but the bathtub is a little slippery and there was no rubber tub mat (I had to put a towel in the tub for traction). A couple of towels had light black stains (reason for 4 and not 5 rating). My toilet got clogged, but I was able to obtain a plunger from the front desk in no time at 12:15 AM and clear the clog myself.  Breakfast came with the room, but I did not eat it. You need to obtain a voucher from the front desk every morning and take it to the hotel restaurant. My room mate tried it once and said that the breakfast was only coffee/tea and some pastries. We ate breakfast at the Golden Griddle down the street on Woodbine and at a Wimpy's outside of the general area en route to our morning tourist destination. All times are door-to-door: it took us 27 min to arrive in Little India (Gerrard St) @ 5:45 PM and 25 min to arrive at Kensington Market (Spadina & Dundas) @ 1:15 PM. Pacific Mall (Chinese stores) and Markville Mall (regular stores) were less than 10 min away too. Highway 404 gets crowded after 5:30 PM, but we avoided the traffic by taking parallel neighborhood streets (we are tourists and were not in any hurry, and more importantly, we made many discoveries using these off-the-beaten-path roads).  I would stay here again.  Other observations: we passed many of the other Monte Carlo Inns during our driving throughout Toronto, Hwy 7 E, home via Niagara Falls, and here are some quick observations on them: (1) MC Toronto West--central location, but on a very busy road. Lots of stores, but the area seemed well-worn. Too much hustle and bustle; (2) MC Vaughan & Brampton--too far to serve as bases to explore Toronto, but one of them was next to a Walmart and many stores (can't remember which hotel); (3) MC Oakville--right on the QEW and across from a mall on the other side of the QEW, but nothing else seemed to be around it. Very isolated.",4,positive

The two main complaints I had was that I was there on business for an extended amount of time only they have no laundry facilities. They offered to send out my clothes to be washed but it was a minimum of $4.00 per article! Also they have no pool, only an excercie room, but two of the machines in it were broken. The breakfast is good and served in a nice restaurant. The internet worked well in my room, which was an executive suite, so it had two nice TVs and a good desk to work from. All in all it's a good location near Buttonville Airport but the fact that they have no laundry room makes me not want to stay there any longer than a week and a half.",3,negative
5581766,markham\ca\181720\248578\11655073.html,Monte Carlo Inns Markham,"Reservation: I made the reservation through the hotel's own website. Since I reserved more than one room, they considered this to be a group reservation and the cancellation policy changed from 24 hours to 72 hours prior to arrival. This was totally unexpected.  I have read the other reviews on this site and I was really anxious about the possiblity of a last minute switch to smoking rooms. One of my friends also had the bad fortune of being switched to smoking room at this property upon his arrival last year. I really couldn't take smoking rooms because of the small children. Fortunately they gave us all non-smoking rooms. However, I happened to witness some other customers having room type changed and was having an issue with the front desk. I was not sure if it was related to smoking vs non-smoking rooms.  The property: It was a pretty small hotel. The landscape was neat and well maintained. The property and the rooms were quite clean. The beds and mattresses were really comfortable. I really enjoyed the sleeping experience there and so did the people travelled with me. However, the room lighting was inadequate. I guess that was why they advertised their property to be a place for a romantic getaway in the Markham business district.  The corridors were not air-conditioned. There were many ceiling air outlets in the corridors. But the corridors were really warm during our stay (in summer time). I checked with one of the staff and I was told that they turned off the A/C in the corridor to save money. This was the biggest complaint I had with this place.  It had a fitness center in the basement but it was not well publicized. I happened to see it when I ventured off for something else.  The service: Others had made comments about the unfriendly service at this place. Maybe they were right. But I think the staff were quite helpful. They did not give me big grins every time I walked by the front desk but they helped and solved my problems whenever I asked. One of them actually walked to my room with me to check things out personally. Smile or no smile did not bother me. I think the service was quite good.  The breakfast: I had the basic (free) breakfast buffet. They had the typical bagels, pastries, croissants, coffee, orange and grape juice (not sure if it was 100% juice though), milk (in a jar), a big bowl of fruits, plus other smaller items. I did not pay the $3 to upgrade for the eggs and bacons. The issue here was that they were very slow to put out more food when it ran out. During my brief breakfast I saw they ran out of utensiles, napkins, coffee mugs, juice, milk, pastries, fruits, ... etc. It was no Hampton or Fairfield Inns' continental breakfast.  Overall, this is a pretty good place to stay in the Markham area. I think the hotel was well managed. For about $5 to $10 more than the Howard Johnson south of Hwy 7, I would stay at this place again.  My dislike of this place are: (1) their reservation system does not work well enough to give me confidence on what to expect before arrival; (2) the hotel management is running the place too tight (like not air-condition the corridors and providing minimal food for the breakfast buffet).",4,positive
4153715,markham\ca\181720\248578\11655073.html,Monte Carlo Inns Markham,"I stayed at this hotel in late October 2005 after read several reviews in the TripAdvisor, but it really let me down. We booked the non-smoking room by phone 4 days before we check in and had well informed the staff that we will check in late around 11pm as we were returned from New York that day. When we arrived, the only room available for us was a smoking room, and there was only one room left, we have no other choice but to take it as it was almost 11pm at night. The room was one floor under the ground floor, smoke odour, very dim but we could not open the curtain because outside the window was a pathway and car parking area. The internet in the room also no working. We supposed to stay 2 nights, but could not stand for it any more so decided to check out the next day. In conclusion, I will not stay at this hotel again.",2,negative
117986964,markham\ca\181720\248578\117986964.html,Monte Carlo Inns Markham,"Looking for a couples type thing in town at the last minute, the Monte Carlo was available and offered a good selection of rooms and packages. We chose the largest suite they had - the ""King Louis"" (they have only one suite that is larger, the ""King Ranier"" that is a 2 level presidential type suite on the 4th floor - the highest floor).  From their website and with a 5% discount code for this month, the suite alone was $137 (all prices exclude tax). We chose the ""Romantic Package"" for $265 which included a dinner for 2, fruit and cheese platter, chocolate dipped strawberries with whipped cream and a bottle of wine. You also get an upgraded breakfast in the morning (see below). I think the best thing about this package is that you get to check out at 2 p.m. instead of 11 a.m. You will get the best price online through their website and also, the discount hotel websites will not offer packages.  The ""King Louis"" suite is the largest suite and I believe there are only 2 per floor. It is a one bedroom with a king bed, 2 flat screen TVs, a sitting area with double sofa bed, a desk and chair. It also had a mini-fridge and microwave. You get a washroom and a separate 2 person step up jacuzzi that is in the sitting area. Nice set up as you can watch TV while in the jacuzzi and there is ample space around it to have your food be it wine, cheese, fruit. Spacious and relatively clean, the suite is more like a 3.5 star as it did not have the upscale things like bathrobes, granite countertops and marble flooring. Also, the french doors leading to the bedroom did not look like it was cleaned well (glass had fingerprints and smudges, some visible stains from a drink on the door frame).  The restaurant is fairly small and they have a karaoke setup with some flatscreens. The dinner package does not include coffee or tea which will cost you $2.50 each. You get your choice or appetizer (shrimp cocktail or garden salad), entree (steak or chicken with shrimp added with steamed mixed veggies, choice of rice or mashed potatoes). There is a small piece of dessert included that is like a upgraded McCain's frozen cake. I was not expecting fine dining so as long as you don't have this expectation, you won't be disappointed. The steak was okay (not Ruth Chris, Keg but not bad either) and was cooked as I ordered. Servers are attentive.  We had the fruit and cheese platter, strawberries and wine delivered to our room at 10 p.m. and once we arrived at our suite shortly afterward, the food was in the mini-fridge. There was a good assortment of fruit (big wedge of cantalope and honeydew, more strawberries and orange medallions) on top of the chocolate dipped strawberries (9). The disappointment was with the cheese - processed cheese slices cut into small triangles. The wine was not that good either - Monte Carlo's house white.  In the morning, all hotel guests get a continental breakfast. This is pretty basic but will offer you 2 juices, coffee, milk, tea, 3 cereals, one bread, one pastry, one muffin. The upgraded breakfast will get you home fries, 2 eggs any style and bacon or sausage (you can buy this for another $3).  Overall, the Monte Carlo Inn is a 3-3.5 star place. There is a fitness room onsite however, there isn't an indoor pool. They try to cater to business clientelle with 2 meeting rooms and a small room they call a business centre (2 workstations with 1 printer). Weekend parking can be an issue as the restaurant has patrons that are not hotel guests partipating in their karaoke. If you return late and the lot is full, just tell the front desk and they will give you directions to the parking lot of the business building next door (this can be an inconvenience).  As long as you are not expecting anything along the lines of a Sheraton or Hilton, the Monte Carlo is decent place. If you want a more upscale couples weekend, you may want to consider another property - one that is larger and has an indoor pool.

Then we saw the big sign around the Woodbine and Hwy 7 area and we decided to check it out. When we entered the facility there were two lovely ladies working the front I believe their names where Anne and Sheila. They had a beautiful smile in their faces and a very welcoming one. So we decided to ask them how much were the rates were and they both responded at the same time. Which I thought was amusing it actually sounded like they were both insync with eachother or the hotel might have planned this with all their staff. As they were checking us into a non smoking regular room they both presented a nicer sounding room. They said for a few dollars more we can get a nice jacuzzi suite they explained it all in details and as they were explaining it I could picture it in my head which caught my interest I think it was called Louis the 14th... So Anne asked Sheila to show me the room so I have a better idea of what the room looked like and as we were going up to the 4th floor she was explaining to us about a special it was called a strawberry and champange special she was telling us about nice fresh strawberries, with chocolate dip and champange. All I could think of that night was hey what the heck we are both tired why not treat ourselves. So when we got to the room I thought my eyes where playing tricks on me. There it was the room as they have explained it the corner jacuzzi, the french doors separating the room and the jacuzzi it was breathe taking. So when we went back to the nice cozy front lobby we had decided to take the room and the special that was presented to us. We knew that from the moment we walked in to the time we walk out we knew we were gonna be treated well by the staff at Monte Carlo Inns in Markham. I am happy with the service offered to me, the facility is very well maintained, the room was excellent and very clean, the staff including the manager were amazing, and through it all I think that they make a wonderful team, restaurant food was amazing. I would definately recommend this to all of my friends and I will definately come back. Thank you Monte Carlo Inns Markham for a wonderful experience.

If you're a light sleeper you'll find the sound proofing between rooms not that great ... in the new room I could hear people talking until past midnight.

Atrocious service, met with disdain for purchasing from Priceline. double beds unavailable because of overbooking. No non-smoking rooms, was offered for a ""freshening"" of the room, but then it was included in the check-out price.  Unpleasant experience. Manager chided us for purchasing from Priceline, said that they could get much more if we ""would just leave"".  This has very much dissuaded me from using Priceline again.  Will blacklist this hotel from all of our companies/subsidiaries future stays in Markham.

This time I wanted to keep my expenses to a minimum, and the 2-night rate here was very good, excellent in fact. Plus they have free wireless, albeit on a non-encrypted network (don't view any personal/banking info!).  For that reasonable expense, you get what you should: a clean room, decent TV, hot shower, parking. They advertise their meeting spaces heavily in the hotel, so maybe they are OK too.  There were some issues with the vending machine (which sold toothpaste and toothbrush for $7) or $9 if you count the loonies this thing eats...  Other than a crappy vending machine, everything was to be expected, and with no ugly surprises which is great; I have no complaints. Would I bring my girlfriend here? No. Would I take a vacation here? No. But when I'm in Vaughan-Markham and need a ""place to crash"" after a long day in one of our area manufacturing plants, this place feels about right.

150359107,markham\ca\181720\248578\150359107.html,Monte Carlo Inns Markham,"I spent about 40 nights at this property between April and September last year. Needing to be close to the office, the Monte Carlo certainly looked fine from the outside. The property offered me an excellent rate based on my frequency of visits. That ends the good news. The inside of the hotel is smelly with cigarette smoke on the main floor because there are a number of smoking rooms on the lower level. the hallways are neither heated in the winter, or cooled in the summer. The are a bunch of rooms they call suites - indeed just regular sized rooms with a wall in the middle and not very suite-like. My biggest complaint was with the front desk staff. They were unfriendly and didn't seem to care much about their jobs. On one occasion, I was overcharged and when I pointed it out to the desk person, they suggested that they'd reduce the charge on my next visit. I said I'd like to have it settled there and she ""put through a credit"". The problem was, she put the credit through to her personal card and I never received it on my Visa. The General Manager had told me that I'd be upgraded to a suite whenever there was space, but one of his desk people showed me a note on the file that contradicted that. Overall, if you're stuck this place is okay. But the Howard Johnson's nearby offers much nicer rooms, more caring staff even though it looks a little worse from the outside.

I don't think the rooms have been updated since the 80s. Very unwelcoming feel to the suite. There was also a strange, musty smell to the room. The stairs up to the bed creaked really bad. The bed itself was bordering on uncomfortable. Definitely not a soft bed. It was more on the firm side. I did, however, enjoy the really high ceilings in the suite.  The bathroom was old and gross. It also had a cigarette smoke smell to it.   There were two tvs in the room, which both seemed to operate by the one remote--which was incredibly frustrating! when I tried to turn one off, the other turned on.

My biggest complaint is about the coffee cups provided in the room. I, like any customer, assumed that they had been washed in a dishwasher. I had taken my own tea bags and made some tea on the first morning of my stay. The coffee cup had an unusual and very recognizable spider crack in it. I had mixed some herbal tea with my black tea - and it foamed slightly and left a ring around the top of the cup. The next morning when I went to use the ""new"" cup, I discovered that the maid had poorly rinsed out my old coffee cup (recognized the spider crack and the ring around the top of the cup) and put it back on the counter as a clean one.

I will start with the positive aspects, and then move on to the shortcomings.  The bed was very comfortable, and the room was clean and very quiet. The shower had good strong water pressure, and the water temperature was easy to control. There was a comfortable executive-type chair at the desk. Parking was adequate, although I don't think the hotel was very full.  Check-in and check-out were polite but perfunctory.   Even with light blond furniture, my room had a dismal and gloomy feel to it. The window was small and in the corner. The compact florescent lights simply did not give off enough light to read comfortably, and I had a stack of files I needed to go through.  The hotel provides complimentary wireless and wired Internet. The first evening and morning, the speeds were ridiculously slow, rendering it impossible to carry on a Skype conversation. Others were at the desk noting this problem when I stopped to ask about it. The second evening and morning, the problem had been remedied and connections were suitably fast. I'm glad, however, I travel with my own connection cable, because the hotel did not provide one.  The complimentary breakfast was a major disappointment. It includes the limited cold buffet only. You have to pay extra to have a hot breakfast. The water provided for the tea was at best lukewarm. I heard another guest complaining about lukewarm coffee.  While it was nice to have a nice fresh fruit salad available, most of the honeydew melon pieces still had rind on them, and the cantaloupe was hard, certainly not ripe. The milk provided for the cereal was not kept in an ice bucket, and it was on the warm side already at 7:00 in the morning. There was not the option of skim milk I have found in most hotels of the same category.  There are good-sized potted trees on the landings of the stairwell. While they are maybe attractive, I would think that they would pose a significant safety hazard in case of an emergency evacuation, especially if lighting failed or the stairwells were smoke-filled.  The hotel was chosen for me for a conference. I generally seek a hotel with a pool for a morning swim, which this hotel does not offer. If I am staying in this area again, I would probably not choose this hotel.

This is my 3rd 10 day stay here and my 3rd fire evacuation during those stays.   I understand the safety requirements and in a way thankful that the devices worked, but what separates the big chains from the locals is how the communication and customer service steps up to make the situation right again for the customer.  I suspected something was amiss when I first checked in only to discover (not informed at check-in) that the elevator was out of service. When I asked, I was assured it would be up the next day. It remained out of service for 8 more days.  Each fire alarm evacuation occured at between 3:30 am and 6:00 am and once again I fully understand that obviously the hotel has nothing to do with the time, but its the way the staff and on duty manager handled or rather didnt handle the situation that ticked me off.  The manager never even addressed the couple of dozen people standing in the lobby wondering what to do next. There was no evacuation plan to another heated area as the temp was below freezing and of course the doors wide open with firefighters all around.  I started my car moved it across the road and took 4 elderly women to sit in it with the heat on.  By the time the fire trucks left and it was determined to be a false alarm it was 6:30 am and the ladies wanted to get a coffee and some breakfast back in the hotel restaurant.  The damned restaurant manager charged us for the coffee and breakfast upgrade of $4 ea.!! I couldnt believe that! After being evacuated in the middle of the night, the least they could have done was comp the breakfast.

22214922,markham\ca\181720\248578\22214922.html,Monte Carlo Inns Markham,"My stay at the Monte Carlo Inn in Markham was very, very disappointing. My fiance and i arrived at the Inn late Sat night around 12 midnight. I had spoken to the sales and catering manager a few days prior, to reserve a romantic suite. He was most helpful at the time. The ""romantic suite"" that we were put in, the room next to ours had young children screaming at the top of there lungs at 7 - 8 in the morning non-stop on the Sunday. We would have loved to have a nice relaxing night and sleep in a little the next day but obviously i was not clear wheni was making the reservation, I thought this would have been common sense to have our room further away from families with there children. On the Sun we had left our room to check out, when we had gotten to the front desk we saw the supervisor whisper something to the other staff member at the front desk and then ran upstairs with one of the maids that was standing beside him. My fiance then asked is there something wrong? The lady behind the desk then said that the maid sait there might be something wrong with your room. Meaning that we trashed the room or something like that, like a bunch of kids. First of all, when we had left out room there was not one maid that had checked our room yet. It takes not even one minute to get from our floor to the main lobby where the front desk is. So by this maid clearly assuming, she couldnt have seen our room yet and accusing us that we had done something wrong was absolutely ridiculous. My fiance then asked do you always make the customers feel like they have done something wrong? We have never felt so uncomfortable at any hotel we have ever stayed at. We have never ever been treated so rudely in our lives. You accuse your customers that they are ignorant people and have no morals. Obviously there was nothing wrong with our room, so my fiance then said could you please let the manager of the Inn know that he will be hearing from us and that we will be writing a letter of complaint. We paid then left. When my fiance and i walked out of the Inn we both were in complete and utter shock. We looked at eachother and said ""what the hell just happened?"" We were so overwhelmed with the behaviour of the entire staff that morning. Especially the supervisor as that was inexcusable behaviour to treat us like we had done something wrong. If you would like to have a ""romantic night"" at the Monte Carlo Inn and be put beside a family with young children screaming all morning when you are there to relax, have the supervisor and staff treat you like crap and accuse you of things, then i suggest you stay at the Monte Carlo Inn in Markham",1,negative

Saturday August 23, 2014 The groom checked in and was told that the wedding/honeymoon suite that they had booked was not available. They said that they couldn't even get a suite. After much arguing, they finally ""found"" him a suite. A groom should not have to argue with someone on his wedding day. They should have been very quick to apologise and fix the situation. (The problem shouldn't have happened in the first place)  Then my husband (part of the wedding party) checked in and they gave us the wrong room, because although my husband gave them our last name, they looked under the first name and gave us someone else's room. (Our last name could be someone's first name. I was very confused when the front desk called up to the room twice to ask the name of the person staying there. My husband later told me what happened. We were supposed to get a suite. Instead we had a standard queen room. Two of our sets of friends did not book suites, but were given suites instead of a standard room. Later at the wedding we found the couple who got our suite because his first name was the same as our last name. He said ""thank you for the suite!""  The next morning at the check out the front desk clerk and the manager had no customer service skills. They did not apologise for any of the inconvenience. We had to argue with them for at least 30 minutes for them to compensate us. I am not sure if the bride and groom ended up paying for their room or not... They took $20 off of our bill. The manager (in broken English) just kept saying ""this is the price of the room"". They had very poor English. We had to repeat ourselves several times. None of the staff knew what they were doing and I don't understand how they could have screwed up all of the rooms so much.   It was absolutely ridiculous.  The ONLY reason why I did not give them a 1/5 terrible rating is because the rooms themselves were nice... though their ""first floor"" is actually down from the lobby in the basement. Two sets of our friends were down there. I am very happy that I was at least on the 2nd floor. Our room wasn't anything special, but what you should expect in a standard queen room.   There is no reason for us to go back there, but if someone else does decide to get married out there, I will steer them away from this hotel.  Ridiculous.

So maybe that's why the service seemed off - the breakfast in the restaurant was disappointing, from the lack of selection to the poor preparation. The staff made an effort to be friendly for the most part, but it kind of felt that everyone was going through the motions.   We were very lucky to have called early enough to get a room - and for that my family (and our 10 month old daughter) will be eternally grateful. So I cut them a lot of slack, since they were under extreme circumstances.  What I refuse to cut them slack for was what I witnessed them doing to people that called in, desperate for a room. We were only there 2 nights, but they quoted higher rates every time I was near the front desk.

During a stay this winter, I was awake most of the night from the heater that continued to Chirp like a bird, I called the receptionist at about 2am, to report the problem. Upon checking out the next day, of course I was tired from not sleeping and didn't feel that paying the full rate for this room would be appropriate. I was told I needed to speak to Management, Dean, his offer was another night stay at a reduced rate in a Louis Suite. Upon arrival the second stay, I noticed the top of the bed had been occupied by someone, as though someone had just been laying on the top of the covers watching TV. I didn't want to start the evening off by reporting this finding, I just made sure the bed sheets had not been tampered with, I felt the sheets themselves were ok and therefore I didn't start by telling anyone. The next morning I woke up to the sound of water drops,the room I was staying in had a separate living area, I went to that room to find, water from the above room leaking down to the living area of this room. I didn't report any of these findings as it isn't my job to let Monte Carlo know that there rooms are falling apart. Here's what brings me to write this review. I gave my credit card when I arrived, the booking wasn't under my name or credit card. I told the receptionist to only use my card as a security deposit but that I wasn't to be charged for the room. When checking out, the credit card of the person staying with me was given to be charged for the room. I now find out I have been charged for this room, when I gave specific instructions that the credit card was not to be charged for the room.

Located in a not too busy area I was concerned with three days of dealign with the Toronto traffic to get to my meetings, but found in this general area you're not facing long traffic jams or frustrations. This was especially helpful for someone like me who honestly fears driving in high traffic areas - I've spent much of my time in small towns and I'm just not used to it, but if you're looking for information on the hotel itself this information might not be relevant. I booked this hotel using Travelocity's top-secret rates. I had a good idea that it was probably the hotel I was going to get given the star ratings of other hotels. Certainly I was concerned with the reviews for most of the two star or lower establishments and was looking for something affordable where I wouldn't end up sleeping on top of the sheets for fear of catching something. It's probably not a great way to review it, but the Monte Carlo Inn exceeded my expectations. My room was clean and, for the most part, comfortable. I say for the most part because it would have been nice to have a comfortable lounging chair to watch TV. My room contained a bed, an office table and a mini table with two chairs I can only describe as slightly more comfortable dining room chairs...It just left me with the option of watching TV from the bed or from those chairs, which were not necessarily the type of chairs you want to sit down and watch a baseball game in. It's nothing I'd call a huge deal, it just would have been nice to have something I could have relaxed in.... That said, overall the experience was exceptional. The staff was amazingly friendly and helpful. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable. The room was well stocked with ammonites including a fridge, microwave, coffee maker and so on. The management clearly takes pride in this establishment and they pass that along to their staff. The area itself is clean, and you feel safe being there. I had no hesitations about leaving my car in the parking lot, which honestly I was a bit worried about with Toronto being a larger city. Overall I would rate my experience as very good and for those seeking an affordable place to stay you're not going to go wrong here. The facilities are very nice, rooms are great, staff courteous...you really can't ask for much more in a hotel....other than maybe a lounging chair...just saying.",4,positive

We booked out about 20 rooms including a few jacuzzi rooms (Two-story Mezzanine and the Louis 14th). We got discounted rates as I had made the block booking in advance. The rooms are clean, and have all of the amenities you need. The Jacuzzi rooms especially are excellent!! Breakfast is very reasonably priced and tasty. The manager, Dean, is absolutely amazing and was constantly checking on everyone to see if we needed anything. He even gave me free breakfast coupons when I would come visit the family before the wedding, and also gave myself and my new husband a free upgrade to a King Jacuzzi Suite, which was large, luxurious and had a Jacuzzi with Roman pillars in the middle of the room! As a honeymoon surprise we were also given a bottle of champagne. Dean was also very flexible in allowing us to use the conference room for a couple of events. He left a lasting impression on us - so much so that we left a bottle of Chivas for him at the end of our stay :) I would definitely rate this hotel at least four stars, and I recommend staying here if you ever visit Markham!

Friendly and professional, including the hard working maids on our third floor. We booked a bit late for our event and were only able to procure a King bed and a pull out couch as opposed to two queens. Since we were meeting up with university-days friends for a day of golf, we took the room and used the pull out which was comfortable and warm. The room was great (coffee maker didn't work in the morning - no biggie) and in fact had two TV's and the room was clean and the bathroom was great. Located in Markham on Woodbine Avenue, the traffic was endless, but that's what you get when you have concession lines as your arterial roads. Very suburban. A nice amenity in the hotel was their restaurant with a complimentary continental breakfast or upgrade for just $5 to have bacon, eggs and toast or an omelette. Very good. The coffee was the best (honest). There was nothing that I could complain about and plenty of praise for Monte Carlo Inn.

Sheets seemed to be in need of replacement, They offer free breakfast but it was really basic with orange and apple juice and coffee and tea. The only ""warm"" food was a single toaster for the bagels and bread. They did not even offer oatmeal. Cold cereal and some pastry only. You did have the option to upgrade to a warm breakfast but would need to pay a small fee. In the evenings they have karoke in the onsite restaurant and I was glad our room was on the other end of the hallway. Nothing really within walking distance, you would need a car. There is no pool at this hotel. I believe they had a small fitness center but did not go to see it. I did not have neighbors in the adjacent rooms so was quiet. Ac system was good and good variety of channels on the flatscreen tv. Probably would not return again but would try the other markham suites and hotel in markham with a pool.free wifi is available but slow for streaming. Room had a fridge and microwave which was nice,",3,negative

I must say that I enjoyed my stay here and here is the complete review of my 3 nights 4 days:  Parking: Parking is great, there are a lot of space to park. There is also no charge to park here.  Location: close to the highway, it is 3 minutes away from T&T (asian grocery store) and shoppers and other restaurant/ shopping area. There is also a very close walking distance pool/bar.   The room: The room is pretty small – we got a standard queen room and it is very small for me and my boyfriend. (I guess I am used to the more renovated bigger standard rooms from bigger hotel chains) but I am not complaining I am just saying the room was pretty small. It is very clean though and well made, the bathroom is very small as well. One of the things I like about this inn is that it has a microwave in the room so if you want to reheat food it works great. It also has a mini fridge. The room has a safe but our safe wasn’t working at all. Also it is very accessible and easy to go in an out from our room to outside.  The staff – the staff at the front desk were friendly and smiley. The housekeeping staffs were amazing and they did a great job cleaning our room.  What is included: If you have not yet stayed in a Monte Carlo property before, you get a Diamond Rewards card where you can gain points and what not. Also they provided breakfast when you stay – the breakfast buffet is only cold breakfast like muffins, breads, coffee, cereals, yogurt, and fruit salad. If you wanted warm breakfast like eggs of your choice and bacon/ham/ sausage you can pay $4.00 for an upgrade breakfast; that’s a pretty decent deal. Wifi is also included – it is an open wifi you don’t need password.  I thought it said it had a pool but we didn’t see any pool when we went to the recreational area. The gym was pretty small but it is doable.  Overall I had a pleasant stay at Monte Carlo inn – the hotel price and amenities are great and the service is awesome. I recommend this to everyone who is planning to visit Markham/Toronto Area and would definitely go back here!

This although we searched and booked for 4 people.   Also the reception desk and the sales manager where extremely unprofessional. He was complaining that in the high season combined with the commission he has to pay to booking.com, he would not make any money. Like he is not the one putting the price online in the first place.  On the evening of check in the hotel could also not show any proof that the extra 15 dollar per person is justified. The reception promised the proof would be there in the morning. But obviously it was not there, and the morning reception just wanted us to pay. Also they, the sales manager and the hotel manager could not provide any proof.   In the end the sales manager just walked away. But as the room is booked via credit card they could just take the extra cash. This feels like stealing and theft.   Note that in the other 15 motel/hotels in our trip this extra charge per person was not there, nor any such remark was ever made. We always paid the CAD amount on the printscreen from booking.com, except at this hotel.   We feel cheated and ripped off and strongly recommend other travelers not to book in this hotel.  Free breakfast is only for bread and jam. If you want eggs and bacon, they charge 4CAD. 4 dollars is not free at all. And the staffs comments: you picked the upgraded breakfast. What part of free do they don't understand... score of 2.5 is only because apparently that is the lowest number. A minus score would suit better.",1,negative

It was also very clean (and I am fussy!)  I was pleased to find a microwave + bar fridge, as well as a good single-brew coffeemaker. Room was spacious with very good TV and WiFi.   Never had to request additional or missing supplies (which is unusual) and that surely was a plus.   If I had to add any criticism it would be that the bed really needed replacing, as well as the blanket, sheets and towels. They were very clean, but quite dated and not of fine quality. The bed was not as comfortable as most in hotels.That being said, I would nonetheless stay there again.   Again, contrary to some of the reviews I found the front desk staff to be friendly, polite and accommodating at all times, without exception. People who found them to be rude must have been rude or difficult themselves. I treat people with respect and normally get the same in return, as was the case all weekend there.

He mentioned that if our guests booked 6+ rooms for 3 days each, that he would allow us to use the conference room for free, even though we were happy to pay for the use of the room.  We took all the information from him and passed it on to our guests who started booking their room with Monte Carlo Inn Markham.  About a month after our meeting with Dean, my Fiance e-mailed him confirm our booking and that is when we found out that Dean had decided to give the conference room to another party. Not only that, he didn't even have the courtesy to call us and let us know that he was doing this. Did I mention that he is the ""assistant manager"". To make the story short, he not took our business, with promise which he didn't intent to keep.   Now, only a month away from our wedding I have to look for another venue.  THANKS MONTE CARLO INN

The breakfast was better than most regular continentals. It included fresh fruit and a variety of bagels, muffins, danishes and croissants. One morning I came early to pick up my family to take them out, and the manager even offered to include breakfast for me, even tho I didn't stay there.

10738722,markham\ca\181720\250005\10738722.html,Hilton Garden Inn Toronto/Markham,"I booked two rooms at the Markham Garden Inn over the Canadian Thanksgiving weekend for one night (Oct 6), as we were in the area for a family function. We had originally planned to stay at the Hilton Suites Toronto in Markham, but members of my party were smokers, and the Markham Hilton has gone non-smoking. We arrived at the hotel around 1pm, and asked if we could check in early, as our function was starting nearby at 2 and we wished to freshen up. The front desk staff was very accommodating; however, they at first did not have us booked in two smoking rooms on the same floor. They were able to rectify the error, & we were able to drop off our luggage & freshen up. The lobby was quite nice, with free coffee and juices to the side. There was a restaurant /dining area to the left of reception, that looked fine as well. The rooms themselves were typical of a Garden Inn; we had booked 2 rooms with 2 queen beds each, which took up quite a bit of room. The rooms were clean, and the bedding, both pillows and mattresses, were VERY comfortable - we didn't want to get up in the morning to attend the breakfast we were invited to!  The bathroom was adequate, although it was looking somewhat dated, and a little bit worn, but it was clean enough. It turned out that the other members of my party, who stayed down the street (about 2 miles away) at the Hilton, wished they had stayed at the Garden Inn - there was construction going on, which started at 8 am, & interrupted their sleep. The Garden Inn is on the outskirts of Toronto, in a mostly business area, that is being developed. There is a plaza with several restaurants next door, and a convenience store nearby. The Garden Inn does serve breakfast, which is not included in the room price. While we didn't eat in the restaurant, the $12 Canadian for the food that I saw on the buffet didn't seem to be worth the price. One definitely needs a car to get around in this area. If I am in the area again (as I expect to be) I definitely would stay here again.",4,positive

We were in utter shock the way the staff had grilled us. I asked politely was there a problem. And she said ""Yea, there is"". What kind of attitude is that? I will never return to that hotel nor would i ever recommend anybody to stay there. Do not make any assumptions just because you see a large crowd of people. That type of behavior was highly unacceptable. More training for the staff as well as the so called manager is much needed.

It was a good bargain for just a little over $100 / night including taxes (<100 without taxes) through Expedia.  The location is good and bad. It's in Markham, the suburbs, but right off two highways (404 and 7). We wanted to be in Markham, so it was ideal. It may not be a great base for Toronto visits. As I found out on this visit, Toronto traffic could be horrible (worse than NYC). You need a car here. There's lots of good Chinese restaurants / shops nearby. The location itself is quiet.

The CHECK-IN: Pros: - We arrived the hotel at around 4pm. The check-in was very smooth. We were the only one checking in at that time, so no waiting in line. Cons: - We were always given 2 key cards at the other hotels, but we got only 1 key card with this hotel. - The front desk guy had no pleasant smile or eye contact with us. Wonder if he was so shy or what? We didn't look scary!  The ROOM: We got room 313 on the 3rd floor. Pros: - Had everything as described. 2 Queen Beds, Cable TV, Wireless Internet(no need to plug a cable to the desk lamp), mini fridge, Coffee maker, Microwave(wow!), in room safe, iron, hair dryer, etc. Things were nice and clean and new! Cons: - Small window, so the room wasn't very bright. - The mattress was way too soft and bouncy. We disturb the other with a small move, and had hard time falling asleep. I got a sore back the next day.  The FLOOR: With Ice machine and vending machine.  The LOCATION: Close to highways, close by many restaurants(walking distance).

This room advertises itself as providing amenities to the business traveler.

There are two televisions also. one for the bedroom and the living area. the t.v in the living room is on the floor level and it cant be pulled out to view at different angels. i usually like to watch tv at least at eye level.

This HGI was larger than most HGI's, as the lobby felt a little more upscale but overall, provided the consistency one would expect when staying at an HGI.  We stayed in a room with two queen beds. For three adults and quite a few piece of luggage, the room was spacious enough. The room decor was slightly dated, i.e. floral motif, but on the bright side, the room did feature an LCD TV. As with every HGI, there was complimentary wired or wireless high speed internet, which was pretty fast and reliable; microwave, coffee maker and refrigerator, the three features which my parents loved having in the room. The bathroom was bright and spacious. Lastly, I liked how they had a safe in the closet.  During our visit, I used the fitness center, which was equipped with up to date equipment. In addition, I loved their pool and whirlpool, which was indoor and had a shower area to use before/after pool use. One morning while my Dad and I were still fast asleep, my Mom sneaked downstairs to have breakfast. She went for the Continental option which was about $8, otherwise the Full Breakfast Buffet was about $14. She said that she enjoyed it very much.  TIP: Self-Serve Coffee/Tea is complimentary every morning and is hosted in the lounge.  Service was friendly but most impressive was our room attendant who serviced our room three of the four nights we were there. She always greeted us very genuinely with a warm smile and was very kind and friendly. Not to mention, our room was always spotless!   Regarding location, again, it was ideal for our needs. The hotel is located in a suburban/business area, just off of Hwy. 7 and is within short distance to several dining options and highways.

When I arrived at the hotel about half hour before check in the front staff didn't offer any assistance beyond telling me check in was at 3 and the room wasn't ready. She kind of sound annoyed that I would even ask, and only offered to hold my luggage.  Since 3 was going to roll around quickly, I choose to sit down and relax. Once checked in, I was told I had complimentary water in my room due to my reward program. Um, they forgot to leave the water but no big deal as I still had most of mine from the flight in. And the cleaning staff opened my door about 15 minutes after I got into the room. She ran away though when I said ""hello"". So I was not sure if she was dropping off the water - it was very odd.  Beyond the odd beginning, the hotel room was a good size. The bed had the ""dial your comfort level"" for sleeping - no remote but I was able to easily adjust the bed so I slept really well. Very typical hotel room - with a seating area. Larger than I expected. I was close to the elevators, but it was very quiet.   Breakfast typically has a charge but my company has a deal that gets it for us complimentary. It was around $12 though as the price was displayed. They do make omelettes, bacon, eggs, sausage, along with fruit, breads and other breakfast items. It is set up like a buffet.  The lounge in the evening was a nice place to meet up and enjoy a drink or have a bite to eat.   There is also a swimming pool and fitness room.

He paid attention but didn't pester me with asking how things were or if I needed refills. He just paid attention and took care of it before I asked. The restaurant manager came over after I had finished and asked if everything was to my liking. We got into a conversation and he asked where I was headed. I told him and he ran off and got me a google map of directions to the place. Made me realize it was so close I could walk rather than take a cab.  Then, due to my schedule, I was hoping for a late checkout. I spoke to the general manager and he agreed to 4 p.m. which gave me time to change back out of a suit and travel home in comfortable clothes. I think he would have agreed to a later time if I had asked.  There are several restaurant choices right next door and shopping is a short walk or drive. It's about 25 minutes from the airport and this was a $70 fare in a very nice ""taxi"" which was more like sedan service. Take 407. You can avoid the toll but the traffic isn't worth it.

Lots of restaurants nearby within reasonable driving distance including ethnic food as well as the standard North American chain restaurants. Staff were helpful and the cookies are a nice touch.",4,positive

The rooms are quiet given its location on a busy road. There's no restaurant, but basic breakfasts are available at a surcharge. I can only think of one other place within walking distance that has breakfast available. There are a number of bars which are local for afternoons/evenings which also do lunchtime/evening food.   This is quite far out if you are planning a trip to Toronto city centre. It will cost in the region of $75 in a cab, and although a bus stop is outside the hotel; you will need to take 2 buses and then pick up the underground - this takes an hour, but considerably cheaper than a taxi.

And I do not say this as a bad thing... When you book a Garden Inn. You are not seeking 5star accommodations... Well this is a good business hotel, staff is super friendly... All the hong kongnese girls at the cafeteria and front desk were professional and delightful... The common areas of the hotel are well above average...... But upon entry in our rooms we were greeted by these invasive strong cheap odor... You know the one that comes out of aroma sprays that instead of have a nice essence they are typically used to hide other odors...... What's strong and highly annoying experience..... Thinking back to our checking in...the gracious gentleman at the front desk made a call to someone, know I think it was housekeeping.... My guess is that someone rushed to turn on the AC and quickly spray that heinous aroma in the room.... Let's just say. We had 2 rooms. Both same situation. We both left the doors open for over 45 mins... We are. Not sure if the smell dissipated, or we just got used to it...... Now... The rooms are big and comfy... Nice queen bed great mattress and decent bedding.... The room had a sofa and a working desk. The wifi was above hotel standards... Fairly fast even handled some Skype video conf, I was impressed. Bathrooms are quite nice as well. Very clean fairly updated and just above standard toiletries . The towels. Well. Let me remind you this is no 5 star... Well on the towel realm this is a low 3 star... I had three body towels. Which kind of made up for their size and quality... They were rather narrow... Would go around me no problem but on my waist it looked like a mini skirt. So I had to use the three towels... After every shower.... Maybe also due to the fact that they were rather thin or worn out...... Now beware... If you are one of those that require a top of the line shower in the morning...... Take note that the hotel (in what I assume was a ""green"" and savings effort) has put funky shower heads that look like they will provide spa type water dispersions of choice just by moving it a bit... Well. This device works ok if you don't mind a very poor stream of water.... Yes my friends if you use showers to wake up , this won't do it.. And if you plan on lathering your whole body with plenty soap as I do... Be ready to spend extra time due to the slow rinsing of the truly poor stream of water... Which is wisely disguised with enough noise as it comes from the shower head contraption ...... All in all this is a true business hotel that for an extra $13. Will give you a nice breakfast..... And it should fulfill most business travelers expectations... Just make sure to ask upon checking and for room service to keep the ambiance spray away from your room... This is no joke...

The toiletries are nice (Neutrogena), though the bottles are hard to re-close. The towels are nice and thick. The room has plenty of spare receptacles, and the wireless internet worked well in my room (my colleagues in the other rooms had problems with weak signal strength, but thankfully, there are also wired connections in each room). The pillows are quite comfortable, with each bed having three, one of them down-filled. The sheets are not fitted, and keep untucking from under the bed whenever you pull out the bed cover for the night. It annoys me, but for most people is not really a big problem. The room has two phone lines, and two phones - one corded desk phone, the other one cordless, by the bed. Each phone works with both phone lines - very convenient since I was staying with my wife, and we at times had to have simultaneous conversations going. The room has a little fridge, which may actually be a freezer - we bought some fruits and put them on the bottom shelf, but the next day they were frozen solid. Also, the fridge makes annoying swishing noise, though once I fell asleep, it did not bother me. My colleagues had complained about noise from the neighboring rooms, but our room was fairly quiet.   I would stay here again, if it were not for a few problems during my last stay: The staff is not very friendly at all - you walk past the front desk to get to the elevators, and they would NEVER say hello to you. The in-room coffe makers smell with coffee grime, so if you want tea in the evening, you are out of luck. Also, the cups in the room are regular ceramic cups with paper covers - I prefer disposable cups in sealed bags, which you know are clean, rather than the regular ones, that the housekeepers may be wiping with the same rugs as who knows what (those TV expose's still stick in my memory). The wake-up call did not work very well - I had cancelled the 6:30 calls for the weekend (by talking to the operator), but the phone rang at 6:30 on Saturday anyway - very annoying, but this is not the worst of it. During my stay the fire alarm went off twice in the middle of the night. Both times it was false alarms, but since you don't know that, you have to get out of bed, and go downstairs. I am all for functioning fire alarm systems, but having false alarms twice in a week is too much. To make things worse, the hotel staff standing by the front desk had not offered any apology, or even say Sorry - instead they seemed rather annoyed with the people asking them questions.

Sure, the lobby got a grand make-over and I assume the rooms got some sort of updating but they don't look nearly as posh as the lobby.  My room was big enough--very standard American size for a two double bed room. However, there were some issues: the drain plug on the shower wasn't attached, the shower pull sticks (both up and down), the hot water isn't consistent (goes from super hot to warm), and toilet runs off and on.  But the worse part? The worse part was the inconsistent Wifi. Sure, it was free for hotel guests, which gets them a point, but if it drops in the middle of an email I was writing or the middle of a text message I was writing on my phone, you loose that point. I have no idea why it kept dropping me but it did it every day I was at the hotel.  The hotel is close to many corporate offices which is a plus for business and there are some good eating options near by (especially if you have a car).  The hotel offers a hot breakfast each morning for around $18CAD. Not too bad since you get to pick the kind of eggs, toast and waffle/french toast/pancakes. The waitresses are super sweet and will get you a diet coke if you don't drink coffee.

Alarm, microwave, shower head, etc. all working well, though the refrigerator was somewhat wobbly and noisy. They are a bit stingy with towels, however; ask for extras.

If you don't feel like eating in the hotel there are a vast number of restaurants close by with every cuisine imaginable.

172248418,markham\ca\181720\250005\172248418.html,Hilton Garden Inn Toronto/Markham,". I am a frequent visitor to Markham and have stayed at most of the other hotels in the area. While most of the hotels offer decent clean rooms,that is about all you get. Many of them seem to have discontinued their full breakfast menus however I am happy to say this Hilton Garden Inn has not. They offer a full breakfast (hot and cold) with excellent service,and your coffee cup never sits empty.  For me and I think for many travelers, full breakfasts are important,because one does not want to go out and shop for a place to eat breakfast.The convenience and reasonable charge is so well worth it.  Last time I stayed at a nearby competitive hotel, and they had done away with full breakfasts. It was a help your self to a very poor choice of food which is why I decided to try the Hilton Garden Inn.  As long as full breakfasts are offered and the high quality accommodation is still there, I will be returning here when i next visit.  I did have a minor mishap when I discovered that the guest next door was or had been smoking despite the fact that the entire floor was non smoking. I could smell the odor seeping through under the dividing door. i called down to the receptionist and they immediately changed my room and kindly offered me a free breakfast. I don't hold the hotel responsible for this because unfortunately,there are always guests who are irresponsible and inconsiderate. There are smoking rooms on other floors.  As a suggestion, I would recommend that this hotel does away with all smoking rooms and make this a non smoking establishment.This would not necessarily stop an inconsiderate guest, but they would be advised of this when they made their reservation,and would hopefully look to another hotel that does allow smoking.  This is a fine establishment that is very clean and comfortable. It provides outstanding service and a great breakfast to start your day.

173596349,markham\ca\181720\250005\173596349.html,Hilton Garden Inn Toronto/Markham,"This was an excellent hotel for the price. The lobby was very attractive and welcoming. It was a very nice touch to have water flavoured with fruit and cookies in the afternoon and evening and complimentary hot beverages in the morning. The rooms were large and there were many extras that were welcomed. The room had a fridge and microwave. The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable and the linens looked fresh and new. The rooms themselves were very clean as was the bathroom. The only thing I would caution is not getting a room near the elevator. We had one and it was fairly noisy when people got off the elevator. The salt water pool was nice, but the deck and seating area is fairly small. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel and will certainly try a Hilton Garden Inn again.",5,positive

I was met with a friendly welcome and personal attention in each of these three areas every time. The service I received here was equivalent/superior to higher end hotels. The rooms were your typical Hilton Garden Rooms (including mini-refrigerator, microwave) and were in good condition. The only area that could use improvement on is the beds. The mattress was too hard and the adjustable feature on the bed didn't seem to work or at least I couldn't feel the difference.  I used this hotel for business and it was very adequate for my needs. There are outside dining options very close by and walking distance.  I would certainly stay here again.",5,positive

From the moment we booked the hotel room (night before our stay), I was very impressed. - Booking staff was very accommodating however they gave us the wrong type of room which was discovered when we arrived at hotel. - Front desk staff corrected it the best they could when we arrived at the hotel. - Lobby, room and hallways were extremely clean! - Breakfast was the best addition to the room for the price. - Lady who was serving at breakfast was very prompt professional and even remembered that we needed milk not cream the next morning with coffee. - Cleaning lady cleaned our room while we were at breakfast as per our request as we were working from our room and once we started working we didn't want to be disturbed. - The only thing that wasn't perfect was the last morning the chef didn't get our order out quickly enough - many people arrived in the restaurant up to 20 minutes after us ended up getting their food first - maybe they need to put the requests on the board immediately to avoid too many orders being piled up and some individuals waiting very long. - Front desk staff ended up splitting the invoice as this what we needed to do for our employers.  Often we see commitment statements posted in hotels, here they actually live it! Very clear in my mind that the management really cares about the customer experience and that this philosophy is also shared by the staff!

The lobby was comfortable and inviting, the staff friendly and helpful. The bar was way beyond anything I've experienced in other HGI's, but seems in keeping with the trend I'm seeing in the Hilton properties. The restaurant served a decent (not great) dinner menu, but a bit on the expensive side, despite all the local competition (probably 50 restaurants within 1 kilometer of this hotel). The bar also had a couple local craft beers, unusual in this type of hotel, but very welcome.   Breakfast is a bit on the expensive side (again), but was quite good, with excellent service. The Denver roomette was cooked perfectly and the distribution of ingredients was pretty even. The staff poured coffee every time I was thinking I might need more, and did a nice job.  I used the exercise room, which had 2 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, and a recumbent bike as well as some weights. I found the first treadmill I tried did not incline, but worked fine otherwise. The second one was in perfect working order. Didn't try pool.  The room had a king with a comfort setting mattress. In my case, not well adjusted as the sides were uneven, but overall it was very comfortable. Everything was clean, and in excellent condition. Plenty of space for the desk, bed, etc. Internet speed was fine, no problems doing anything I needed to do.  I tend to go with Courtyards or HGI, I would absolutely stay in this HGI again over the nearby Courtyard. It is now setting the bar for business oriented hotels.",4,positive

The wait staff was terrific ensuring that we had everything we needed and the food was great. After dinner it was back to the room where we slept in comfort. The next morning we were downstairs for the breakfast buffet. It was not your usual buffet where you find everything lukewarm. We had to order the hot food (except toast) through the wait staff.

We used the gym and it was adequate. The temperature was very warm in there though for working out.   We didn't use the pool or hot tub, but it looked clean.  The manager's reception, with free apps, was very good. The food was hot and fresh. There was a variety of different foods, including calamari, pizza, spring rolls, veggie tray, cheese and crackers, chicken strips.  We ate at the restaurant in the hotel. The service was slow considering we were the only two people in the restaurant. The food was mediocre. Expensive for a salad and chicken.  Overall, the hotel was the usual dependability of the Hilton chain.

When I arrived, I asked if there was a complimentary shuttle as the reception was literally less than a 5 mins drive- I was in heels, it was very cold out and I had intended on having a drink or two so could not drive. They advised that no they didnt have that- instead they called me a cab which charged me a flat rate of I think $10- what a rip off.  When I went to check into the room, I was greeted by some shady looking people who were just about to or had just got in an altracation right outside my door. It made me feel very uncomfortable. I was intending on telling the front desk as I felt weary about leaving my valuables behind but the shady people were hanging downstairs by the bar, right by the desk.  While in the cab, I even tried calling the desk to let them know, but there was no answer. I tried several times. Nothing.  My final complaint- they didn't offer free water bottles and there were no curtains covering the windows. Get ready for the sun to beam in!!  Would I return? Absolutely not. There are plenty of hotels right beside this hotel that will probably be better worth your money.

The selection was competent but relatively basic.  The room size was good sized. I had 2 rooms: King + Double Queen. The room sizes were identical and the Queen did not feel too squished. There was a flat screen tv + small empty frig and microwave (big plus).  My issue with the hotel is security. Granted, it is relatively small. However, security in a business friendly location is paramount. Around 3 a.m. or so on Saturday night, someone had gained access to the room floor(s?) and started pounding on every door. I woke up and I heard this person pounding. Another person in my group called the front desk and they sent someone up to look but they never caught the person. I assume they caught the person on video. When I complained the next day, they offered to comp my breakfast but did not actually do it. (Another start deducted for placating me without actually doing anything).  The breakfast buffet was $13.95 but the point was that a non-guest should never have been permitted on the premises. If it was a guest, they should have noticed the person was intoxicated and offered to escort. Either way, the front desk should have noticed someone coming into the hotel at 3:00 a.m. and been attentive. It isn't that big.",2,negative

This was an absolute bonus. Just for this we would go back in a snap. Excerise facility with a pool if you like. In room refrigerator n microwave a great help. Reasonably stocked room. Good cofee maker n clean crisp linen. Good towels compared to Quality Suits. Much better property than quality suits not so far away where we had stayed via priceline and were stuck with a smoking room on a long weekend when nothing else was available. We had few rooms n had a good stay here being very central to where we wanted to go. I would though watch for breakfast. The cooks definitely need good training. Table waiting need honing up on skills. Though they likely tried. Tim Horton is acorss the main road easily walking distance. In neighborhood there is LCBO n Macdonald. Great location if you want to be near Scarborough as this one is in Markham. Across is Sheraton. Maintenance could look at drain plugs in bath tubs. Having a puddle in bathtub is not like Hilton. Bathroom Fans could be lint free n refrigerator in rooms could be checked. We had several rooms and would surely go back anytime. Keep up. Staff exceedingly friendly n approachable. Reception wonderfully trained i must say. A good property.,3,negative
230616928,markham\ca\181720\250005\230616928.html,Hilton Garden Inn Toronto/Markham,"I was in a family reunion in Richmond Hill area north of Toronto over an recent extended weekend . All the hotels in the area are mid range three star hotels. I have stayed in the Sheraton before and it was really crowded. Stayed in the Embassy Suite a few years ago which is now the Hilton Hotel and Suites and I found it too busy with lots of coming and going. This Hilton garden inn is by far the best. The rooms are clean and adequate size. Beds are comfortable. Front desk personels are courteous and efficient. Price and value are excellent. Breakfast is not included but you can get a discounted coupon for a minimal fee and offerings are plentiful. It is located on Highway 7 and the junction of 404 and 407 toll road intersection. It cannot be more convenient. I arrived at Pearson airport at 6pm right after the rush hour and I drove the rental car to the hotel and arrived in 30 minutes. I did go through the paid toll road which had no traffic tied up. It is a fantastic bang for the buck if you have realistic expectation for what mid range hotels offer. However, this is far from downtown and it will takes you one to two hours to go down to harbour front attractions. Driving on Don Valley Parkway to go downtown is agonisingly slow and public transportation needs multiple connections and exchanges. Do not consider this hotel if all your activities are in downtown.",4,positive

Great start, the porter was efficient, friendly and helpful: the check-in staff, whilst a little more stuck in ScriptLand, still quite pleasant.  As it says, all the rooms are suites and mine was roomy and comfortable. Housekeeping was exemplary and I even left a healthy tip, which normally grates against my Brit hatred of the N American ""tip-for-everything' culture! I had breakfast in the hotel on a couple of mornings, which was very good.  The fitness room could do with a little rennovation and the serviced Health Club's staff seemed unclear what rules and charges pertained to hotel guests (but dion't check much anyway!).

Check in was efficient, tho they did not offer a bottle of water and I had to ask for my Diamond Privilege. Later in the week, I asked for another bottle of water and was charged 2 CAD. Why is it Hampton Inns will provide a free bottle for a Diamond yet? I would prefer HGI pick up on this from the Hampton chain.  The room was nice. The colors were yellows and calming. The beds were NOT the sleep number system, but the mattress was fairly firm and had a tough wire around the edges. I was glad it was only a few nights on that mattress.  The room lighting was adequate. I recall seeing one lamp damaged and had to ask for a repair.  The bathroom was ok, a tub shower and adequate counter   The breakfast was good, but on the final morning, the cook said they were closed at 5 minutes before closing, but the Maitre D confirmed they would honor my breakfast request.  Overall, I liked the property and its location. It did have ups and downs but overall was a good value and a good stay.

The Hilton Garden Inn does not disappoint with the QVC (Quality Value and cleanliness). The location is superb with easy access to the 404. Room with two double beds was spacious and well appointed. Internet both wireless and wired worked flawlessly during my stay. The bed was firm and the pillow soft at the end of each day. Bathroom and shower worked well with all the hot water I could use. Interesting that in the design of the floors that the ice machine and drink vending machine are on opposite ends of the hotel. The lobby was full service with both a bar and a well appointed breakfast dining area. The welcome gift for honor club members is nice. The warm cookies were a nice touch although I had to give mine away as I am celiac. The only negative about my experience is having to pay $3.00 for a travel tube of toothpaste. I know it was my fault for forgetting but really $3.00 for the convenience? I suppose I am used to lesser brands that don't charge for the forgotten toothbrush, razor or toothpaste. Would I stay here again, maybe, there are other choices in the same area.

Everyone was pleasant and very service oriented which made the stay even better. Arrived late on Tuesday night and with the snow and travel I didn't want to go out for dinner. I called for room service (which closes at 9:00 pm) but what a relief to find out that they would accommodate my order. The food was delicious. Next morning, Debbie took care of us at breakfast and was very pleasant and accommodating. The hotel lobby bar provided us an area to get together as a team with a few drinks and a lot of laughs. The rooms were clean but needs to be updated (re: carpeting). Bed was comfortable as were the pillows. Really enjoyed my stay there.
 
 
 Room Tip:  I was on the second floor which was great as I could take the stairs if I wanted to.

WOW!!! Got a beautiful corner suite that comprised of 4 rooms! I had a kitchen/living/dining area.....nicely appointed bathroom.....an office room with DSL.....and a bedroom with windows wrapping around two sides of the building. I have Hilton Gold and I'm sure that helped with the upgrade! If you really need a room to spread out for business purposes, small entertainment needs or just with the family in the North Toronto area this is the place. I could have done some entertaining in this unit with its seating area, table, kitchenette and 3 TV sets!! The decor is very modern and lots of nice touches....nightlight in bathroom, heat lamp in bathroom, entry closet by front door, ability to close off the bedroom and study from the main sitting area. I ordered room service and it was fantastic...plus it was real nice being able to spread it all out on a full size table and not have to do the usual business travel routine of removing my laptop off the desk for use as a dining table!

Staff was helpful and cheerful. Room was very quiet even with its close proximity with Markham's busiest main road Hwy. 7. Price was reasonable even with booking directly online.

The first night I had a terrible sleep because there was no black-out curtain, so I thought! The next day I spoke with the front desk … the black out curtain is behind the sheer curtain. I did not see it - it is not obvious. She said it's not the first time … it's happened before where guests could not find the black out curtain. On the third day, the suite was reserved so we had to switch to a standard room (2 queen bed). This room was equally as good and comfortable as the one bedroom suite with the same amenities, except not as big. Other amenities include complimentary wi-fi, fitness centre, indoor pool, hot tub, change room with lockers and washrooms, restaurant, bar, lounge, snack shop, beautiful outdoor garden/terrace, free parking. Ordered room service - chicken fingers, salad greens with feta cheese, ranch dressing, fish and chips, caesar salad. Happy with the meals, fresh, super prompt service - food was delivered in 15 minutes, professional service.

Later in the day when I brought up the premium internet the Manager himself came out and asked if has proof it was included, a few smartphone taps later on their website I prove it, he then suggested the complimentary Wi-Fi should be sufficient and if I need more he made a note in my booking to credit it if charged.

Hampton regulars will note that the ubiquitous fruit salad was actually served thawed - not frozen. However, it was still tasteless.  Noise was the only problem with this clean new property. The bathroom exhaust fan had a constant rattle. I complained, nothing was done. Much worse was the horrible loud background music that played in the hallways, elevators and breakfast room. Trying to eat breakfast and hear local traffic, weather and news reports on the wide screen TV while being blasted by loud awful generic music was very unpleasant.  Except for the noise problem, this could be a great hotel.  Neighborhood appeared very safe. Many restaurants and a large new Longo's supermarket nearby.  This hotel is located a ten minute walk from a weather sheltered bus stop. Two buses (purple west to Richmond Hill terminal, then a blue bus south to Finch terminal) and a southbound subway from Finch gets you downtown in just under two hours. About $14 per round trip - a lot cheaper and less aggravating than driving and parking downtown.

We stayed for business for a week in mid september and overall it was a great experience. However, I gave them the benefit of the doubt on a few points because of how new the hotel is...hoping these points will improve in the future.  The hotel is in a great location at hwy 407 and Woodbine. Neighbourhood is safe and clean, and it is right behind shopping including Costco. Not a lot to see or do in walking distance, however, if you are staying in Markham you will likely have a vehicle and in that case many shops, restaurants and Markville mall are within 10 minutes drive.  The hotel is spacious, new, fresh and clean. Facilities were nice and well kept (pool, fitness area etc.) The front desk staff was friendly and inviting.  Our room was large and clean. Thoughtful features in the room include: Wall safe, charging station in phone for iphone (both styles) and android gadgets, and ottomans for the sofa in addition to Hampton regular features of fresh duvets, laptop table and pillow selection.  The lobby features 24 hr coffeee, tea and hot chocolate.  Hot breakfast, as usual, is included.  Improvements that hopefully will come:  Although there are a few complaints on here about it being noisy, our bathroom fan did not work.  Breakfast service needs improvement. On two days, there were no forks. One day, the omelettes were frozen solid in the middle as were potatoes. Garbage was often piling up and unattended to. Tongs are not appropriate for serving potatoes-the time the lid on the hot items is left open for people to serve themselves with this utensil guarantees cold food. Cream was often not refilled for coffee. Staff was observed on multiple occasions chatting with each other while guests were neglected, otherwise the door to the prep area was closed tight making it difficult to get service.  Our room did not have a directory and none was brought on request. Only flyers for Chinese food were given for restaurant selections, 3 of them!  Towels were random-some days we would get 4, some days 2 sometimes no bath mat.  Overall, we really enjoyed our stay.

The Hampton inn's never fall short of expectations and this Hampton inn is no exception. I arrived super late in the evening and was greeted with a smile as if it were morning by the clerk. Walking in to the room was like entering an oasis as the room was so spacious it made it easy to just dump all baggage at the door and still have room to not trip over yourself. The room was very tastefully decorated and thought out.there is even cabinetry shelving near the microwave and fridge. Almost makes you want to move in permanently! The one thing that looks pretty cool from a distance but is not the greatest idea practically was the bathroom with a shower stall similar to that found in gym locker rooms. There is no divider/enclosure between the shower stall and the remainder of the bathroom. The cool factor wears thin when you realize that you'll never have dry feet in the bathroom after a shower is taken until the floor dries or you manually wipe the water that would normally stayed enclosed were it not for this design.

I stayed here for two nights in December 2014, and loved it. Apart from being relatively new - open for the last 3 months - it was really clean. The rooms were comfy, the staff were helpful, it really was great. This is one of the Hampton Inns that have what I call the Great Room, a large room with high ceilings for their morning breakfast, but also a great spot to meet and get some work done too.",5,positive

Our 2-Queen bed studio was large, luxurious, and an excellent value. The quality of the room was outstanding in every way, including value. The free in-room wifi was among the best I have every experienced. The spacious, comfortable room was in fact one of the best that I've ever stayed in for this price point, and an excellent deal that I will gladly enjoy again in the future. Only two small flaws to report, and only one of them is the hotel's fault. Despite its high level of furnishings, the room did not contain a single bureau with drawers for clothes. So we had to live out of our suitcases, which was very head-scratching. I even called the front desk after a thorough search, but they confirmed that these very nice studio rooms contained no bureaus or drawers of any kind for clothes. The second flaw is that all studio rooms in this hotel are on the West facing side, and across the hotel parking lot, about 100 yards away, there is a nightclub which produces audible noise even at 2 AM. The noise is not loud, but noticeable at that hour. However this is a new nightclub and may have opened after the hotel itself, so there is not much that Hilton can do about it. Overall, however, I found this hotel to be an excellent value, with a courteous and friendly staff, very nice rooms with above average furnishings for the price, and a very convenient location right off Highway 7 and near the 404 expressway. I highly recommend this new hotel to anyone who requires a good hotel room at a very reasonable price.",5,positive

Mini fridge, microwave, single serve coffee maker, iron, hair dryer, lots of clean towels, tv with cable, mini safe. Its everything you expect a hotel room to have. Breakfast has a nice variety of savories and sweets to accommodate everyone's taste. The parking lot is huge and we always find parking up front near the entrance. Extremely friendly staff who is always smiling and making sure you are happy with your stay.  I'd say its about half an hour away from the city of Toronto but we mostly stayed in Markham for the shopping it has to offer. It's literally just a 10 minute drive to all the shopping and eating spots we wanted to visit.

There were a few aspects within the room which seemed out of place though. I was really impressed with the number of electrical / USB power connections, the quality of the TV, the over-all quality of the room's design and furnishings. As well, the bathroom was well presented with the walk-in shower being a plus for me. The above seemed to contrast against these slight negatives: The room did not have any ""guest directory"", which surprised me when I initially was wondering what restaurants / room service was available (still don't know). Nor was there any ""home page"" via the internet connection that was able to provide any useful information or e-services. Additionally, when I decided to make a drink, my only option was PAPER cups... which really seemed ""cheap"" compared to the class of the room. Granted I left a note for the room service staff who provided some champagne glasses the following day, which was better than the paper ones - but just standard glasses would have been what I would have expected by default. Also, the TV line-up was reasonable, however I was disappointed to see a lack of the local community channel. Finally, I did find the bath towels to be rather small... a robe would have been a nice option. Over-all, I thought the room was great - just a few small things would have brought it to the level I felt it was trying to achieve. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.

The rooms are always modern, comfortable and very clean. This Hampton was no exception and the newness of the hotel was a bonus. We recently booked here as part of a group when travelling with my daughter's sports team. One of our parents had reserved a block of rooms for our group under our team name well in advance. Several of our parents had difficulty booking these rooms. When I called one evening, the male at the desk had no idea what I was talking about, couldn't find our group reservation and was less than helpful telling me to call back in the morning. When I did call back the next morning, I didn't get much further. I was finally transferred to the voicemail of a sales manager. After a third phone call I was finally able to book our rooms for two nights. After all of this, it was somewhat frustrating when we arrived upon check in to find that they only had our room reserved for one night, rather than the two that the group reservation was for. After much back and forth, we did manage to get the room for a second night, despite the fact that they said that the hotel was full. Our team was also somewhat disappointed that all the rooms that we had booked as a group were nowhere near each other and in fact, all on different floors.   The rooms are very spacious and the beds are comfortable (we had two queens). There is the standard fridge, coffee maker and hair dryers. As others have noted, there are no traditional drawers in which to put any clothes away, but rather there are three wire baskets in the TV unit. Complimentary Wi-Fi is limited to 3 devices   Several of the persons in our party however couldn't get a good night's sleep due to the bed in the double queen rooms being too close to the heating/air conditioning unit. Thus whomever was sleeping on that side of the bed had air continually blowing on them all night long, regardless of what the temperature was set at. One person in our party even attempted to turn it off, but couldn't.   There are plenty of amenities, shopping and restaurants nearby, and the hotel is only about twenty minutes from Vaughn Mills Mall. Entering and exiting the hotel lot was somewhat confusing, as we always seemed to be driving through a shopping parking lot, whether it be a plaza or the Costco......perhaps we were missing something but it was not obvious how to get in and out.

Our room was an adjoining room on the 5th floor (we were not related to the customers in the adjoining room) and unfortunately lacked enough sound proofing between the rooms and/or the main door. The group next to us was a lady or ladies who were with others rooming nearby, I'm guessing they were there for work and making plans for the next morning. They chatted at the door for a few minutes and there was opening/closing of the door a few times. We were surprised to hear all of this as they were not overly loud. Also, their high heels could be heard on the wooden floor of the room's foyer. The bathroom was spacious and bright though the shower head seems 10 inches too high. I'm not sure why Hampton's are placing their shower heads so high these days. I understand that tall people may have complained that the head's were too low before but now it's too much the other way. Breakfast area was clean and well-stocked as usual.

The room was lovely, clean, quiet (this is huge this day and age!). The breakfast bar area was well attended. They are pet friendly.  BUT the on-line booking process did not share costs that were later added to our credit card. Signed in to my Hilton account to book. Have been booking hotels on-line for over a decade. Chose our room, treble-checked their pet requirements (no fee), even shopped pricing. Read the fine print (again, we have a dog. You do these things). Booked. Then got the credit card statement. CHARGED IN AMERICAN DOLLARS. As a Canadian Hilton member. AND charged $50 pet fee .CANADIAN Hilton membership?This was a first. Made a single attempt to resolve this with no joy. Voice at the end of the phone isn't responsible for the website or how Hilton chooses to automatically assume Canadians booking on-line for Canadian hotels would want American prices. But couldn't / wouldn't do anything for me.  Hampton Inn is a good brand, in our experience. But two months later, I'm still grinding my teeth over this. So, when booking on-line, take care. A first for me, someone who is always looking for the 'hidden' costs, caveats, exclusions, etc. when booking on-line.

Second night noise grew worse. Sunday we had to check-out Very Early due to a horrendous vibration and noise coming from equipment on the roof. It was deafening and disconcerting. The front desk tried to say it was coming from another building down the road. When we finally got out of the hotel, there was no noise outside. So much for sleeping in on a Sunday.

We even made the drive to Vaughn Mills so if people are looking for a place to stay when going to Canada's Wonderland this would work. The front desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful. They always answered any question with a smile.  The rooms were clean, the beds were comfortable and very spacious. They were able to place all of us on one floor which was helpful.

A bit of a lengthy process considering there were other guests checking in and only one staff at the front desk. Check out time is 11am, which is an hour earlier than every hotel I have stayed at in the past. Asked for a later checkout of 1pm, but I was told this was impossible. I asked for 12:30pm, again not ok. The best they could do was 12:15pm. So an extra 15 mins to push it to 12:30pm is impossible?? Very poor service.  The young lady working the front desk is clueless and does not provide good service. I thought I had lost my laptop when I was checking in. I went to the front desk to ask to see the cameras, but the lady at the front desk didn't know how to operate the computer system running the cameras. There were no staff to help and the lady at the front desk seemed like it wasn't a big deal. I was very annoyed at her lack of urgency to help. She definitely seemed mentally on the slow side.   There is no manager on duty it seems, so if you have any issues, you'll have no choice but to deal with this less than professional lady at the front desk. Good luck with that, as the chance of her helping is very low.  Sure, I usually stay at 5 star hotels, so I suppose my expectations were set a bit high, though I still think they should have accommodated my late checkout request, especially considering the very early checkout time.   The room was decent enough (king suite), but the pillows were horrible and the extra blanket felt like I was sleeping with sand paper. Nothing fancy, but good enough for the 1 night we were here.

The carpet in the hallways was the most attractive I've seen in a hotel lately  Service was very friendly and accommodating, although we didn't need much attention. The breakfast area was large and well equipped, with everything working perfectly (for example, I think I had the best waffle that I've ever gotten from one of those ubiquitous waffle makers).  The weekend rate seemed very reasonable, especially when converted to U.S. dollars. The only negative was a lack of nearby restaurants that we were interested in, but we did find a place just a few miles away.

We travel to Toronto every year to visit families there and to shop around. I have had great experience with other Hampton Inns that I stayed in so wanted to give this Hampton a try.   Check-in took a while because the gentleman that helped us seemed like a new employee that is still ""in training."" But, he was very friendly and nice and briefly told us where the amenities are such as the pool and the gym.   The room overall was clean except a few small hair that my mom found on the bed (under the blanket) and some dust on the bathroom counter and tissue paper container.  The biggest complain that I have is the mattress, which was utterly TOO SOFT and my body sinked in when I slept. It was very uncomfortable and I end up with neck, back, shoulder, and head pain. My second complain would be the lack of towel rack/hook in the bathroom. The only useful hook is the one behind the door. The towel rack next to the toilet is very inconvenient to hang any bath towels on it. The rack next to the sink is good for small washcloth/small towels but can't even hang shirts or other bigger stuffs.   Our room was a little tight in space and kind of small. We had two queen beds but only one chair in the room, no couch or other chairs. At another Hampton Inn that my husband and I stayed in last month, we had a king bed with one couch and two desk chairs in it. This explains the reason for the 4-star review.   One positive thing though is that we had a room on the side facing the hwy and right next to the elevators but was not noisy or loud at all.

When it comes to hotels, I am very picky with the way it looks and it's cleanliness. This was satisfying, considering the fact I had no choice in where we were staying. The only complaint I had (from what I remember) is the carpet seemed cheap and very thin, not so nice on the feet. The only person I would not recommend this to is someone who doesn't have access to a car or drive. The location can be really fun, but it is not downtown, it's harder to get from place to place.",4,positive

So what is the point of checking in online then?  Stayed here for 1 night, however, expected a bit more for the price I paid. I could of gotten a better price staying downtown. The room was large. Had a little kitchen area when you first walk in the room, then a living room area open to the bedroom. Sink was separated from the actual toilet and bathtub area which was convenient.   A fairly new hotel so it was in excellent condition. Pool was decent size, as well as, the gym. The breakfast dining area was fairly large and the canteen was hidden away when it was closed. Free breakfast had a very good selection (oatmeal, omelettes, sausages, cereals, waffles, hard boiled eggs, muffins, toast, yogurt, fruit, coffee, tea, hot chocolate) and Joanne was excellent making sure that everything was replenished quickly and that everyone was satisfied with their meal. Front desk staff was friendly as well. Free coffee, tea and water was available all day in the foyer.  A few things that could be improved upon: safe should not be vertical (what can you put in it…not even a camera and your electronics would need to stand up instead of lying down…could fall out and break when you open the safe), no bathrobes available and they ran out of cookies and milk.",4,positive

Unfortunately my stay was a nightmare.  After the first night of having a room right next to the express toll road and woodbine which made for a loud night, Despite having the deadbolt on and putting up the ""Do not disturb"" sign. I had housekeeping repeatedly try and open my door and start banging on it when they couldn't get in. They obviously saw the sign because I got a call from the front desk later confirming that housekeeping made a note of this. I told them what happened and i was told ""it would be looked into"".  The breakfast was very poor quality compared to other Hamptons i've stayed at. 2 hot items available each day and one of the items (The seasoned potatoes/home fries) weren't even properly cooked. No toppings were visible for the waffles. The omelettes were plain (They usually have cheese in) and they took a long time to get hot coffee out.  I went down to the lobby during the night and there was no one at the front desk (I was looking to buy something to drink as they have no vending). I yelled ""hello!"" to no reply until i went to the elevator phone, pressed zero and low and behold, someone leaves the office to answer the phone.  Next night, I requested a late checkout in the morning, they weren't able to go as late as i would have liked but either way i still had housekeeping start hammering at the door again! Even with the Do not disturb sign and even with the late checkout request. Why me?  When i went to check out, i mentioned what had happened again and was just asked ""Do you need a cab booked? no? Okay bye""  This is a brand new property which is going to be let down by mediocre service, this stuff really needs looking into.",1,negative

The hotel has everything you'd expect from a Hampton inn, excellent service, a great morning breakfast, a clean exercise room, and the room itself had plenty of space and the room still smelled new.   Our experience there was quite good except for two minor things. The sink in the washroom for some reason seem clogged up, so the water didn't drain very quickly. The other thing was that I am an HHonors member and for some reason they were not able to apply my account to the stay.

Also closet space was good and the in room safe was handy for storing anything valuable or sensitive you do not want to carry around with you. A couple of minor drawbacks. One, the hotel is located within an area with lots of businesses but very limited restaurant presence within walking distance. However, the hotel has a list of 16 restaurants that will deliver to the room including American/Canadian, Chinese, Japanese, and Thai. Also, if you have a car, no problem, as there are plenty of restaurants within a short drive. The only other thing I wish they had was wine splits in the little hotel store.

There was also oatmeal and fruit salad for healthier options. The coffee was also very good. I used the gym facilities and they too were kept very clean and had decent equipment in excellent working order. The pool is salt water chlorinated, which I always find a little easier on the eyes and skin. There is no hot tub, unfortunately. The only complaint I would make is that there was a large group of 9-year-old boys from a hockey team staying with their families. They were, as one would expect, very loud and rowdy. The hotel allowed them a very late check out on the Sunday (after 3, I think) and the kids were constantly making noise, and running up and down the hallways. I complained to the front desk once, but the noise was persistent. I think it was a poor decision to permit such a lengthy extension to that particular group because they were bound to be disruptive and noisy, given their ages. Not all parents ensure their kids behave properly in hotels, and this group certainly did not. Perhaps not the best decision to have allowed such a lengthy entension.  Other than that, I am very pleased with this hotel and would highly recommend it.

For Toronto, $100 for a weekend night is very reasonable. While hotel sits right at corner of 407 and Woodbine, traffic noise is bearable because 407, being a toll road, is very quiet at night. If you are a light sleeper you should face north and ask for an odd numbered room (BTW, used the online check-in, where floor plans are backwards).   Also, while our neighbours were very quiet, you should know that all rooms with 2 beds have doors to the adjoining room. So, if you value quiet, reserve a room with one King.  Rooms look and feel new with very comfortable beds, a selection of wonderful pillows, coffee maker, safe, microwave and finally a hotel flat screen tv with a good picture and lots of channels.  Check–in took less than a minute - with on-line room selection and advance check-in available. Front desk staff friendly and courteous.  While breakfast is standard Hampton fare, muffins and yogurt seemed of better quality plus a bonus of paper plates rather than the annoying styrofoam jobs at most Hampton. Maybe, one of these days, they might switch to greener reusable china plates.  All in a great stay...one that keeps me going back to Hampton",5,positive

337424397,markham\ca\181720\6833951\337424397.html,Hampton Inn &amp; Suites by Hilton Toronto Markham,"Please note: This is a hotel location that allows pets.   I rang for the elevator from the floor of my stay and when the door opened I started to walk towards it when two grey Schnauzers ran out off leash. They immediately charged after me and tried to both bite me and my puppy, that I was fortunately holding in my arms at the time of the attack. Both dogs were clawing at my legs and barking, one trying to bite my puppy's heads and the other one trying to bite her hind legs. The owner of the crazy dogs finally kicked and pulled them away by the neck and ran around the corner as I stood stunned at what just almost happened, as I walked away unscathed.   I did not want to complain at first, as I thought this might bring bad light to the chain's decision to allow pets on their property. But after more thought, realised this was a serious danger. Especially as during the holidays we had witnessed a lot of children on the property. I went to my first point of contact, the first desk, to advise them of what had just happened. I spoke to an Asian young man named Vincent about the incident and when I further asked if there were any property rules for the guest dogs, such as them required to be on leash when out and about, he seemed confused. For the longest time he tried to tell me about pet rates for the hotel, not understanding the situation. After clarifying my concerns, instead of asking if I was physically okay, instead of trying to locate this man that ran off into one of the hotel rooms, instead of looking up what the hotel guest dog rules were, he just stared at me and did not know how to deal with the situation. All he repeated said was how he was not sure about dog related policies for the hotel and when I asked then if I could speak to someone who could handle the matter instead, due to its seriousness, I was told he would take down my room number and have someone get back to me - that was it.  Morning after, I still had not heard from anyone so I again went to the front desk. This time I was greeted by an Asian young woman, I think it was Susan, who was much more friendlier, sympathetic and more willing to help, but still had no idea about the policies. My point was not really the legal policies, but the immediate safety concern of those in the hotel premises with an owner who thought it was okay to unleash two aggressive dogs the night before. Nonetheless, it highlighted a clear lack of training from the location's employees, as they all waited for one manager who they thought might be able to help with my concern. Not surprisingly, this one manager was away and would not return until after my stay was over. This was not a realistic solution, yet it was the only one I was given.   In the end, I will not return to this location or chain, as this seems to be a bigger issue of lack of training with serious situations. We did not feel safe at all, nor did we feel like we were being cared for. The lack of service was incredulous. You get what you pay for I guess. I will be saving my money for someplace else next time. Please reconsider, especially if you have small pets or young children, as you run the risk of aggressive pets running amok at this location with no help from the establishment to secure safety even after a dangerous incident breaks out.",1,negative

The city center hotels of comparable level and service were asking about 3 times as much as the Hampton Inn here plus another $20/day for parking so I decided to get a rental car and pay the $10/day downtown parking. Though the rush hour traffic was nothing to brag about, but 45 minutes or so each way was not too bad.   The Hampton Inn is new enough that you can almost smell the freshness of the paint. The room was modern, large, clean, bright and enough lighting for some work. The double room I had was stocked with not 4, but 6 bath towels. I can practically stay the entire stay without having the towels replenished. The breakfast was ok with some hot and cold items as well as a waffle maker. But in the afternoon hours, they had a tray of cookies at the front desk. Since it was first-come-first-serve, it was mostly gone by the time I got back to the hotel around 6:30 or 7:00PM. The bonus in the hotel is that there is a gym with quite a few treadmills and an indoor swimming pool. Putting a few miles on the treadmill each night really worked me up an appetite and for that, there are quite a large number of restaurants near by. The largest Chinese shopping mall in Canada is within walking distance which has plenty of choices, including a restaurant by the the famous Ding Tai Fung dumpling chain.   I cannot say anything negative about this hotel. Upon check out in the wee hours of the day, the gentleman even offered to pack a bag of breakfast for me. Now, that's beyond the call of duty. I ended up not taking the offer, but did appreciate the nice gesture. I would definitely return the next time I am in town. I give it 5-star because it exceeded all my expectations.

There is a separate sink area for the bathroom. Although the toilet/shower room is quite large, there is no place to hang or place clothes. There is one hook on the back of the door but that was used for towels. The shower was a bit annoying though - it had two settings - a pulse, and a shower spray, but on the shower spray setting the water came out of the shower head in a circle. Also, the shower head was placed too high up on the wall.   The bed was very comfortable. Decor was quite modern and the hotel and the rooms were very clean.  Wifi worked fine.

It was a good size. Lots of outlets. Bathroom was nice with wooden floors. Plenty of towels. The staff here were all very nice and helpful. Although the price range is about the same, the Hampton Inn's exterior is very blah and the Hilton not too far away looks a lot more upscale.

We picked this hotel because one of the family was here a year ago and they love it. The hotel still brand new and modern decor, the breakfast dining area still the best I seen of a Hampton Inn. The reason I rated only 3 stars ( average ) because the noise issue, because I can hear my friends ( their room are connected with our when both doors open ) conversation and their blow dryer when the heater/AC is turn off. Another noise issue was from the night club evil ( sorry, I mean Evo ) across the parking lot. We already on the top floor and the music was pounding on Saturday night and Went a little soft on Sunday night. I tried to set the heater little higher to drown the noise, but the heater was so close to the bed and the air kept blowing to my feets. We were scheduled for one more night, but we decided to check out after my friends left one day before us. Minus the noise issue, the hotel is very good and breakfast ( standard Hampton inn breakfast ) staff was working very hard of bringing the foods out. Be advised that little league hockey teams love this hotel during hockey season ( weekend ).

The bathroom fan was loud but we were told because the room we stayed at was next to the fan (on 7th floor). I didn't like the gap in the window curtain. I had to clip it together with a paperclip so the light wouldn't shine through in early morning. Poor had a little too much chlorine. We only used once and hesitated to go back.

Originally planned a week long stay in another Markham area hotel, but not happy with it, so moved here half way through my trip.  Read a lot of reviews in tripadvisor and thought this would have been a good choice, but ended up quite disappointed.  Noise was our main problem. Our room was a connecting room, which happened to be filled with kids that didn't really behave late at night or early morning hours, must have been occupied with at least 2 or more kids. Then guests upstairs were making noises with something like bouncing balls and heavy walking in the middle of the night. Our room was facing Woodbine ave., which was loaded with truck traffic during the day and into early evening and morning hours.  Bath tub didn't drain well, ended up with half of the bath tub filled with water after finishing my shower. Trying to adjust the shower head was a big challenge, not just that it was installed high above the tub, but also having difficulty to get a good water flow.  Everything else was OK. Staff was helpful but could have been more cheerful. Room had all the amenities we need. Our twin queen bed room was very clean with no unpleasant smell. Mattress was a bit on the soft side.  With the price, it's still a good deal. But we ended up checking out the next day instead of the planned 4 nights, and moved back to downtown.
 
 
 Room Tip:  Top floor and away from Woodbine ave.

We arrived late on Friday and were given an accessible unit with a King size bed (which we had booked for) on the 4th floor (we would have preferred a higher floor). The receptionist apologized for not being able to offer a different room (indeed, we found out that there was a wedding on Saturday and lots of families were staying at this hotel).    On our second day (Saturday), after a day of excursion, we returned to rest in late afternoon. At about 7:00 p.m., we were just about to leave for supper when the night light in the washroom suddenly failed to work. We called the front desk, and a service man promptly showed up at the door. He quickly replaced the light bulb, at which time we also informed him that the washroom ceiling lamp had failed to work. He quickly returned with a ladder and a new bulb; however, he was unable to fix the lamp. He apologized for the inconveniences indicating that the maintenance person had just left for the day, and that he was not equipped to do the repairs. We then asked him to have it fixed the next day.  As we passed the front desk to go out for supper, a friendly staff (Rafie ) stopped us in the lobby. To our pleasant surprise, he already knew about the situation and offered to upgrade our room to a Junior Suite on the 7th floor (top floor). We were delighted. After we informed him that we also had another reservation for Sunday (a standard king size bed) for our son and his girlfriend and we'd like to be close to one another, he pleasantly offered to upgrade that room as well to a Junior Suite on the 7th floor.   The Junior Suite is very spacious; having a large desk to work on where I used my lap top while my husband watched TV (the TV can be swirled to either the side of the couch or the bed).

The hotel is a decent location for travelling in to Toronto if you're happy to drive - it's right off the highway, so close enough to get travelling wheb you need to, but not affected by any noise from the highway. A option for travelling into Toronto: We decided to do a 20 min drive to Finch station and then catch a train into downtown Toronto.  Rooms: The room had a musty smell i.e. it didn't smell fresh and clean, however to the naked eye it looked clean enough. The windows could not be opened to allow frwsh air in either. Our family members who stayed in a separate room came home to find their room had not been cleaned ... two days in a row. Breakfast: I personally did not enjoy the breakfast at all. It was very basic, which would be fine if it was all freshly made, however it did not give that impression. Staff: The staff were all very friendly and helpful - definitely no faults there. Extras: There is a small gym with 3 or 4 treadmills and few other items to use (dumb bells etc). This was a great extra and had everything u need for a workout. There is no bar in the hotel for sitting in the evenings. However there are a fee things sold on site such as snacks and soft drinks. A plus as well would be the laundry room which is on site.

The room was very clean with all the usual amenities. Elevators were a bit slow but being on the second floor allowed us to use the stairs when possible.  The best thing about this hotel was its location. We spent two nights in Downtown Toronto to attend the theatre and getting there was easy. A short drive to the Shepard Subway line with free parking eliminated the usual hectic rush hour drive to the Theatre District. Easy access to the 407 and 404 superhighways made driving during the day a breeze.  Next trip to Toronto will include a stay at this great hotel.

I had asked for a room on the top floor but did not get same (I know all requests cannot be met) but I wish we had. I like the top floor so that I don't hear people above me.   The hotel's location is unique. There is no direct access to it, you have to go through a parking lot of stores next door to get into it or drive around the block and work you way in from the rear - not very good access at all.   The parking can be an issue if both this hotel and the one next door are busy because there seems to be only one large parking lot.   Our room was a nice size (king size bed with sofa). The bathroom was also a good size.   The noise level of the hallway was very loud - you could hear everything. During our stay there were several teams or something and at one point at 10:00 pm I opened our door to tell them to be quiet (they were running up and down the halls and yelling). Kids running up and down halls happened more than once - so if this happens to you, call the front desk.  Breakfast in the morning was so so. Each morning they seemed to be out of something and I had to ask for it. The ladies were very friendly and got the items asked for.   This is a nice hotel and if we had to stay here again we would - only on top floor!

398988577,markham\ca\181720\6833951\398988577.html,Hampton Inn &amp; Suites by Hilton Toronto Markham,"My top four criteria for getting a good sleep in a hotel are temperature, darkness, noise, and comfort. Here’s my evaluation: 1. HVAC: Thermostatically controlled wall mounted unit was a little bit loud, but it’s efficiency was great! And it had a ""fan-always-on"" feature to help reduce the noise change during the night when the air conditioning goes on and off.  2. Bed & pillows: my subjective bed rating was 9 of 10 — great! 3. Light tight room: 8 of 10. These “light tight” curtains needed to be just a few inches larger to totally restrict the light. Someone skimped on the design to save a few pennies, and the guest suffers a bit as a result. 4. Noise from hallway and above: great! We were on the 7th floor (top), and heard no noise, even from doors closing in the morning. 5. Food: Fair. The eggs were real, although there were no condiments to put on them (salsa, grated cheese, etc.). The waffle batter was waaay to thin, and made terrible waffles. We were here for 3 days, and the batter consistency did not improve.  6. Lobby and common areas: beautiful — new and nice. 7. Front Desk: Check-in was friendly and fast. Help in directions, local services, etc. was very friendly. 8. Room décor: New and stylish; the bath had large clear-glass shower.  9. Other comments: We chose to commute to the downtown area via the subway, but this will take you just over an hour by the time you drive to the Finch Station and then take the subway. Plan on $12/person for a day pass. Also be sure to AVOID the 407 Highway! This is right next to the hotel, and is a toll road. But if you are not a Toronto resident with a transponder, you cannot pay and will be fined. There are no places on the highway to pay the toll, only cameras. BEWARE!!!!!!
 
 
 Room Tip:  7th floor was great for no noise.

The hotel is near the 407 which is a tollroad that requires a transponder. But, you don't hear the traffic. The area has a bunch of restaurants nearby. There is a mall a few km away and a Costco a block away. A late night lounge is just across the parking lot (didn't visit).  The hotel is fairly modern and very clean. Parking is convenient and luggage carts are provided. There is a meeting room, pool, fitness room and a small shop where guests can purchase sodas, etc.  The desk staff is to be highly complimented for their professionalism. Bibi is fantastic. So personable and professional. Also, very knowledgable and ready to make suggestions about what to see in Toronto and when is the best time to visit the attractions. Upon checking in when she learned that we would be staying five nights she switched our room from from the seventh floor to another floor where it would be more peaceful.  Omar and Jeremy did all they could to make our stay pleasant. When we had a plumbing issue at midnight on our second night Jeremy switched us to an identical room and comped our stay for that day.  Our room, a king suite, was large and the bed comfortable. It is more like a business suite with an extra long desk and sofa. The commode and shower/tub is in a separate room from the bath vanity. Microwave, fridge, iron and hair dryer are provided. There is a nightlight for the vanity area. A safe is located inside the closet. The maids kept the room super clean. Breakfast varies from day to day but is typically motel fare with cereal, eggs, meat, waffles, breads, juice and fresh fruit and, of course, coffee. Unless you come down early the dining area gets extremely crowded.  We really were glad we selected Hampton Inn for our stay. On our last day I ran into the manager and told her so.

A friend came along with me to get away for the weekend. It was a great experience. Check in was an absolute breeze - we were able to use digital check in and select our room ahead of time. I will mention that we were hoping for a view out the front of the hotel, but some of the Trip Advisor tips were wrong. You want an odd numbered room to face Costco. We stayed in room 706, which is on the top floor, right near the ice machine. It was a fairly quiet room. We ended up unplugging the fridge each night, as it was quite loud. Don't plan on watching Netflix here. The wifi (even the premium wifi) is entirely too slow for that. Luckily, we had some stuff downloaded ahead of time, so we spent a good amount of time watching movies - it's also worth noting that the HDMI inputs on the TV are not blocked. You can bring an HDMI cord and work on the bigger screen, watch movies, whatever. There's literally nothing around if you don't have a car - not even a convenience store. We ended up ordering in all our meals, and brought snacks and water and stuff with us. Breakfast wasn't fantastic - I would honestly recommend catching up on sleep and ordering something for lunch instead. It was a SUPER clean hotel room when we arrived. Everything was spotless. It was a fantastic stay! One more little thing - there are bathtubs in most rooms from what I could see, even though the website shows a stand alone shower.

I found the room to be more spacious, obviously without the second bed, however, the space is reduced if you do use the pull out sofa bed. I did sleep on the sofa bed and found the cushion (not the mattress) to be firm and comfortable (I prefer firm) to sleep on. The bed is less firm but I still find it to be comfortable as well. The room does have a refrigerator, microwave oven and a small coffee maker which is very convenient to have. For those who have a lot of electronics, there are plenty of power outlets and along with few with USB charging stations throughout the room. The bathroom has plenty of space to move around, however, there are only 2 hooks to hang your bath towels. 1 hook is next to the tub and the other is on the rear of the door. However, there is a towel bar above the toilet which is too low and near the toilet but this may be an option to hang a 3rd or 4th bath towel. There is plenty of room on the bathroom sink to lay out your toiletries and a lower shelf below. You will find a small closet to hang your clothes and spare pillow and blanket. One thing I noticed with the room HVAC is it turns on and off quite frequently and it may be annoying for the light sleeper during the night.  The breakfast dining room is decent size but it can be difficult to find a table when the hotel is near or fully booked. There are a variety of hot and cold food and drinks to choose from. The room where the food is located is small and can get very crowded and difficult to maneuver around. The staff work very hard to ensure everything is restocked and refilled when things run low. There is a large screen LCD TV where the news is usually on during breakfast but you can watch other channels other time when no one is around. This is a good place to go to if you plan to bring back food and to sit and relax.  The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful.

The room was spacious and immaculate reflecting attention to detail that's surprising at this price point. For instance, the drawers are metal baskets, so a guest doesn't have to feel concerned about accumulated dirt. The breakfast was delicious, featuring really, really good sweet rolls and various coffees. But the best part of our stay was interacting with a caring and friendly staff. Jinell Rahim, the front office manager is a true star! She eased our way by giving us meticulous directions to the hotel's location. A plus when you're driving in a strange city. Her smile and welcoming spirit is reflected in the rest of the front desk crew. The only negative is the distance to the City of Toronto and its many attractions. We made the mistake of driving the 45 minutes to the City proper. Big mistake. We are now great fans of Hampton Inn by Hilton.

102706594,markham\ca\181720\775037\102706594.html,Homewood Suites by Hilton Toronto-Markham,"My husband and I stayed at the Homewood for our anniversary because it was near my parents so that we could leave our child overnight and nearby. I booked the suite with jacuzzi and was very impressed with Homewood suites. 1) Everything is brand new, but not all new hotels are of the same quality. Homewood had fantastic bedding quality, down pillows as well as synthetic. Nothing was old or worn down, stainless steel appliances in the kitchenette, dark woods and the only hotel I visited where the suite looks better than the pictures. Ergonomic office chair should you need it and charming dining chairs for the kitchen table. Neutrogena toiletries.  2) Top notch front desk experience, when I was asking about viewing available rooms for my in laws, the general manager was called down to give me a personal tour, and the front desk representative ensured I had coffee or tea in the 2 minutes I had to wait. When I booked my stay, I requested a late check out and they did honour a 2 pm checkout for us. Very friendly and professional  2) I booked my in laws into the upgraded 1 bedroom suite version, only because they didn't have regular suites left. I had looked at other hotels with regular suites and they were claustrophobic. You could not see the kitchenette from the bed in the regular suites here, Truly the layout was genius and made the suite look much more spacious than it was. The TV was situated in the suite so it could be swiveled towards the bed, or the sitting area.  3) No restaurant on site but a stay includes limited breakfast 7 days/week and dinner 4 nights / week. Excellent value for travelers. I don't really understand those reviews complaining about breakfast as cereals yogurts oatmeal and fruit were available if you got tired of the cooked fare. There is a convenience kiosk that sold snacks (and chocolate raspberry icecream) as well as essentials open 24 hours. There is plenty to eat nearby but you will have to drive in cold weather. 4)Brings us to the point of location. Location a bit tricky on new roads possibly not on your GPS, it's near the highway but at least I could not hear traffic. First Markham place mall is next door (If I may recommend ding tai fung Shanghainese dim sum restaurant there.. surly staff fantastic food and open kitchen open late!) as is costco. But no areas to walk. Still in Markham, you can't expect to walk to the corner store, it is suburbia. 5) Free parking, again it is suburbia, but the hilton down the street does charge for it so I just wanted to mention that. 6) Amenities: 24 hour business center should you need it, 24 hour fitness center, salt water swimming pool (NO hideous chlorine smell), and guest laundry for extended stays though I didn't need to use it.  Best: The suite quality was so good, that I would stay in one of the regular suites without issue, and book my in laws/ elderly parents there for an extended stay. As a comparison, when I checked out the staybridge suites, I would only consider booking a 1 bedroom suite or higher because of suite quality.  Worst: A lot of the roads nearby are new, and may not be in your GPS maps! I'm local and had a bit of an adventure reaching the hotel. You may end up having to take the long way to get into the hotel as well, that's ok. Know that you can cut through Costco parking lot on Woodbine !

Kept getting bumped to the GM, Aamar Samuel, who has so far declined to return 3 phone messages and one detailed email and returned one email in response to the customer service survey. (not sure it was even him that wrote the email). The first time I could chalk it up to a fluke, the second time, with 2 data points, I have a trend-line.

We had a one bedroom king and while it was certainly spotless and clean, especially the bathroom- the bedroom was tiny, as was the separate living room/kitchenette. We never used the l/room or kitchen, but felt a little cramped in a very small bedroom.  If you are visiting Toronto and don't plan on preparing food in your room, this is not the place to stay. You are better off at any of the three star chain hotels in one large room. It is much more spacious and comfortable.  Breakfast downstairs was absolutely AWFUL. Frozen greasy egg patties and sausages was the total hot food served. No scrambled or any other kind of eggs were available. No melons or yoghurts and very limited breakfast cereals. Some overipe fruit was available. The stale dried out bagels and english muffins did not help. The only appetizing option looked like the self service waffle mix but I changed my mind when I saw this long line waiting. I was told that yoghurts are sometimes served during the week.   The worst of this breakfast for me, was providing paper plates and cups with plastic untensils. In my book, you find this in a motel or maybe a 1 or 2 star lodging. It did not go hand in hand with the quality of the accommodation.   I regularly visit Toronto and have stayed at several competing properties in the area, and have to say that this property does not match up to the other properties. The breakfasts served at the other locations are far superior, and again, while the rooms are fine, they are only good if you can use the all in suite facilities.",3,negative

It's quite cozy and homey feeling with a full-size fridge in the small kitchenette. Unlike standard hotel rooms where you generally walk right into the bedroom, each area is partitioned as like in a small apartment. Upon entering our suite, the kitchenette is to the left, dining table in the center and the common ""living"" area further in. The bedroom is separated through a doorway. The bathroom sink is open beside the closet while the bath & toilet are behind a separate door. We were on the 4th floor had a view of the mini-putt green outside. We checked in shortly after midnight and as we headed to our room we noticed that quite a few suites on our floor were occupied (from the many 'privacy please' do not disturb knob hangers) but we hardly heard anyone in the hallways by the time morning came around. Usually you hear the commotion of families and teenagers heading down for the free early continental breakfast spread, but I didn't hear a thing from the hallway. The queen bed we had was deliciously plush - if you prefer stiff mattresses you might not enjoy these because you sink right in.  I wish we were able to try the free continental breakfast but my boyfriend and I slept in. Staff were fine with accommodating our late checkout request, which allowed us to take a dip in the small heated indoor pool downstairs. There's complimentary tea & coffee in the dining area and towels at the gym and pool entrance so you don't have to bring the bath ones down like we unknowingly did. The bath products offered in suite are Neutrogena; a familiar, understated, quality brand. Our only disappointment was that the television and bedside lamps in the bedroom didn't turn on despite being plugged in normally. We compared the connections to the television in the sitting room and tried looking for a fuse box thinking it was a tripped panel, but the ceiling fan above the bed worked fine. I don't think I've ever recalled seeing a ceiling fan in a hotel room and it's definitely a nice touch plus it's a great cooling alternative to blasting the sometimes noisy frigid A/C all the time. All in all, I would definitely try a Homewood Suites again because it really does give you a sense of feeling at home.",4,positive

We stayed for 16 nights and were very comfortable in our suite, though found that the living area was a bit cramped compared to the Marriott Residence Inn we stayed in on our last trip to Ontario.  The food for breakfast was also not up to the standard of a Residence Inn. The selection of cereals, breads, bagels, yogurts and fruit was good but the cooked element of the breakfast was not so good. It was obviously reheated, previously frozen meats, potato products and eggs. Not very appetising! The evening meal , on the other hand, was excellent. The salad selection was terrific and plentiful, lovely bread selection (amazing garlic bread) and the main meal was always lovely. We especially enjoyed the oriental night and the chicken pot pies. My husband raved about the lasagne. There was also a selection of soft drinks and teas, coffees and wine/ beer. I have high praise for all of the staff we came into contact with. The maids who cleaned the rooms were excellent and always left the rooms in perfect condition, the reception staff were also very helpful.  One area not to our liking was the pool though -it was freezing so we couldn't face a second try in it.  The area around the hotel is still being developed, so you need a car to get to any shops or restaurants, although there are lots within a few minutes drive. Costco is just across the road though and handy for a snack, if you are a member. There is also an oriental buffet across the road.

The problems came up because of incidents that occurred. First there was no early check in available on the day of arrival-not a big deal and one we expected however, the hotel did proceed with assigning rooms and checking us in even though the rooms were not available. Time 11:00 AM or so. The parties then went on to the things we were scheduled to do with the ladies returning around 4:00pm and the men returning around 4:45 pm. Only one room was ready when the ladies returned and the second room was not ready when the men got back. Now the hotel knew the rooms were required by the 3:00 pm check in and had even booked the rooms to us in the AM so why were they not ready?  Our next problem came about due to what they say was a construction problem that occurred at between 3-4 AM. The hotel lost some power. The air conditioner stopped, some of the lights didn't work, power outlets were not at full power there was no hot water and the phones were dead. This affected our morning plans. Breakfast was less than hot, hot coffee was not available, toasting anything was not possible. No alternatives were offered. When the power came back on the fire alarm went off !! When I enquired regarding the alarm I was told by a staffer behind the desk it was a false alarm and there was nothing to worry about...that is until the fire department arrived and started to evacuate the sixth floor due to the fact that there was so much smoke on the sixth nobody could see in the hallways. An hour after the fire crews had left the elevators were still not functioning so in order to check out you had to carry your luggage down the stairs by hand.  In these situations I can understand the confusion and frustration but to tell people that its a false alarm when its not is not acceptable. When elevators don't work how are people supposed to get baggage out without help. The actions of staff in the special situation are what set hotels apart from each other. On this front I feel they rate a 3 out of 10

The room was big and clean with a full kitchenette (full sized fridge, sink, counter, coffee maker, plates, microwave, toaster, cups & cutlery).

There was an actual closet with an iron, ironing board and safe inside. Nice, quiet and well appointed room overall, although the view out of the 2 big windows was of the highway just outside.

There was free parking (above ground), which we both appreciated. The front desk staff was very kind and quick and we were in our room in no time at all.

The room also included a couch so we weren't forced to watch television from the bed. The kitchen and the room were very clean, although I did have some issues with the cleanliness in the bathroom. My boyfriend found some, erm, unpleasant stains on the toilet seat. I also don't *love* the idea of just a shower and no tub...and our shower leaked a bit.   Our room had a door to an adjoining room and it was very thin. We could hear a lot of noise from the occupants next door, as well as noise from the hallway.   There are several grocery stores nearby, which is great for stocking the fridge. The complimentary breakfast wasn't anything special--we ended up just eating our own food in our room.  Unfortunately, the pool was closed for the duration of our stay. There was no explanation for this, and we were disappointed, as we'd both wanted to experience a salt water pool.   Overall, our stay was delightful, with just a few hiccups.

The microwave and popcorn was a nice touch.  The bed, duvet and pillow choice (hard and soft pillows) provided a good night's sleep. The hotel is quiet except for the three undisciplined kids in the room next door who messed up the newspapers and statements outside our door as well as the room next to us. The three of them came sliding down the carpet into our papers, making enough noise that I heard them from the bathroom. The mother, standing in the doorway, said ""well, they're only kids"". This is not the hotel's fault. I only mention it in the hope that parents show some consideration for others.  Brealfast is complimentary but not as good as other Hilton properties. We found the eggs and sausage greasy and tasteless.  The pool was closed during the two days of our stay. However, staff member apologized and compensated accordingly so this issue was satisfactorily rectified.  The TV in the bedroom was not working which we did not discover until 10:00 PM.

I have stayed in 11 hotels in the Toronto area (downtown,north york, airport, and richmond hill / markham). This hotel was one of the best that I've stayed at. We rented a 2-bedroom suite for our family and it was wonderful. Spacious, king-size beds, immaculate, comfortable, everything we needed! The only thing that was a little difficult was the volume of the wall-ac units, but I have found that in a lot of other local properties as well. Not a reason to not stay here.  Everything about the property and management was wonderful. I would definitely rate this property as my favorite in the richmond hill/markham/north york area. (rating it in comparison to the Radisson, Sheraton Suites, and Westin Prince).
 
 
 Room Tip:  We stayed at the end of one of the floors - very little noise!

The hotel is conveniently located in Markham - next to Costco and other stores. The suite is smaller than suites we had stayed in the US, but bigger than other rooms we had stayed in Canada. Suites in Canada tend to be smaller than most American ones anyway.  The dining area is a bit small and can not accomodate all the guests during busy times.  The pool and the gym are well equipped.

135355028,markham\ca\181720\775037\135355028.html,Homewood Suites by Hilton Toronto-Markham,"We stayed here for 3 nights in mid July. The room was clean but very small for a 1 bedroom suite. We felt like we were tripping over eachother. The airconditioners are VERY loud and about a foot from the bed and sleeper sofa, so the person sleeping on that side of the bed and sleeper sofa freeze since it blows directly on them. You cannot move the vent to blow in a different direction. The kids often complained it was loud and annoying. Everytime it came on at night it woke me up, so I resorted to turning up the temperature and being hot. The couch is extremely uncomfortable to sit on and even worse is the pull out mattress, the kids slept fine on it but adults would not be able to sleep comfortably.  The front desk staff was nice and helpful, and the breakfast was good. The kids loved the make your own waffles every morning. We only went to one dinner as we were too tired to go out to eat and it was very poor quality. Rice and chewy chicken with frozen vegetables, cafeteria food at best. Coffee is available though out the day which is great, but for some reason milk/cream is only out at breakfast so you have to ask and wait a while for them to bring it ny other time of day.  The pool was great. All 3 kids loved it as it was heated and was never busy. We used it many times. Great to have a kitchenette in the room to prepare snacks and picnic lunches for on the go.  Overall it was an average stay.
 
 
 Room Tip:  Go for the 2 bedroom suite if you are travelling with kids. The 1 bedroom suite is VERY small.

Just minutes from Canada's Wonderland - this was really the perfect location. Free parking (nice & kind of rare in the area). The kitchen was really handy - the full size fridge, burners, utensils, plates - the kitchen was great, even for a short stay it was nice to have cold drinks in the evening without trying to find a vending machine. Bed was comfy. The 1 bedroom suite was actually a 1-bedroom suite; some suite hotels now offer a short dividing wall, but this Homewood Suited is done correctly.  The breakfast was a step up from usual. The food was really pretty good and there was some variety. They also have an evening dinner, but we weren't there to try it; but it is a very nice touch for business travelers or if traveling with families.  The only downside: the internet access (free!) would give a weird error after about 11 pm, saying 'too many guests were logged in'. Now, I know what the problem is (I'm a computer engineer), so I could tell them that they need to reset it OR I knew I had to wait until midnight when it reset. They need to get someone there to redo their service. If you stay there and run into this problem, call and ask them to reset the router or just wait until midnight.  Would we stay here again?

135937577,markham\ca\181720\775037\135937577.html,Homewood Suites by Hilton Toronto-Markham,"We spent two nights in room 115, a handicapped accessible room at the far end of the hallway. Not only was it a hike to the lobby, but the staff workroom was right next door, and the door was the thinnest we've ever seen in a Homewood: we heard constant noise starting at 7AM. It's also right an off-ramp of the 407, so we heard a lot of truck noise constantly. I'd avoid rooms 113-115 at this property, as well as any of the rooms on the highway side of the building.  The staff were pleasant and friendly, and the place was well-maintained. As others have noted, the area is pretty barren other than a ton of Asian restaurants, but parking was plentiful.  Other nits: the door by room 115 (""Door B"") had a card reader, but it didn't work throughout our stay, despite telling several staffers about it. It would ""see"" the card but flash red, even though the card worked in our room (and I did try several cards). One staffer tried his master card, which worked, but that didn't help us any. Fortunately (sort of) the door didn't latch easily, so when running stuff to the car, I was able to get back in. Of course, that's a security issue as well.  The diverter in the shower was broken; I told a staffer, who seemed interested in getting it fixed. I didn't realize it was broken until the second morning (didn't try to switch the water the first day), so they had no opportunity to fix it for us.  The TV was too small for the room, and too far from the bed, but given the abysmal non-digital cable service, it didn't matter, as we wouldn't have watched it anyway.  Breakfast was the usual Homewood overcooked, overheld, previously frozen eggs. They did have good thick-cut bread, but the muffins were gluey. There's a Tim Horton's nearby, however!  Overall, I can't give it high marks, but it wasn't that bad, other than the noise issues.

This hotel is located quite a ways from Toronto. Have your car ready at all times because you're located in the heart of little Asia and there are quite a few businesses that advertise only in Chinese, especially most of the nearby restaurants.  After saying that, the hotel has a great location to the nearby major road system. You have an interstate system that can take you almost anywhere you want to go in less than 30 minutes. The hotel staff was friendly and very helpful upon check-in.  I checked into my two-bedroom two-bath suite and notified the manager that my room had a strange smell and they immediately fixed the problem.  This hotel is one of the few that offers you a hot breakfast and a hot dinner included in the price. The breakfast wasn't bad, but not great. It did the job, you have to remember that all of the other restaurants tend to offer a continental breakfast and this one actually had real meat canadian bacon along with waffles, eggs, etc.  We enjoyed the breakfast and the dinner was a surprise, they serve an actual dinner. During my three-night stay we enjoyed their offerings for dinner even the nights we ate out. They offer dinner and breakfast for a long period of time.  If shopping is your thing you might want to shop in Toronto and not the immediate area.  The pool was warm and it was cleaned every day while we were there.  The hotel configuration is very strange, it is a L-shaped with only two elevators (side-by-side) for the entire hotel. Of course the elevator is near the entrance and my suite was as far away from the elevators as possible. So if you get a family suite prepare for a walk.  The grounds are well kept and very nice with plenty of free parking.  The staff was always alert and willing to do whatever to make our stay pleasant.  Cheers  Maryland Vacation",4,positive

Before I go into details, let me mention that this is the first time I stayed in homewood suites properties.  Choice and selection: I was looking for a standard hotel near and around Toronto for 3 nights with Kitchen. With a 21 months old baby we preferred a hotel with a kitchen. I looked for homewood suites and mariott residence inn properties, out of all this one gave me the best rate. Though Markham was a little far away from Toronto Downtown, I did not mind much. First reason is the price they offered for a King bed suites and markham being a known place ( had been there for 3 weeks in Markham Hilton Suites). Booked the hotel over phone, requested for a late check in. It was confirmed.  Hotel room and amenities : Reached hotel well past midnight. Very nice and cosy room, king size bed with kind of bed that suits our sleeping preference. LCD TVs are in both bed room and living area. Kitchen is small but good enough for two. Microwave, dishwasher, dining table, sofa, working area very smartly designed.  A full platter breakfast to start the day. Hotel also provide complimentary light dinner between Monday - Thursday, which takes away the dinner worries from business travellers.   Out of the box : As we reached hotel very late, we needed milk for our baby. After reaching hotel, I thought I would pick up milk from nearest Walmart super centre or any other 24hrs shop. To my surprise, the hotel guest manager told me there is no such 24hrs grocery store. Either I have to go to gas stations or forget it. When I explained him that the milk is a must for the baby, he opened the kitchen and gave me a sealed bottle. Amazing. This is something I would remember forever. This is what is called service.   The internet never worked in the room. I spent alomst an hour with the tech support guys and finally realized they do not have expertize to resolve the issue for that night. Manager offered me a different room to switch over next day. Pleasure.   Would definitely like to go back, not just because of the amazing experience also because of the friendly nature of staffs which makes it a BIG difference",5,positive

The rooms are very comfortable, clean, and quiet. I've also stayed for several weeks at the Markham Residence Inn and Courtyard. Comparatively, the rooms at the Homewood Suites are more comfortable, better furnished, and quieter. The disadvantage of the Homewood is location. As other reviewers have noted it is located on a crazy lot that sits behind strip malls. A common shortcut to get to the hotel is to cut through the CostCo parking lot. The lot closest to the hotel is vacant and construction has just started (Nov. 2012). There is one restaurant within walking distance. The Residence Inn and Courtyard definitely have the edge in terms of location. The Residence Inn and Courtyard have a half dozen excellent restaurant choices within walking distance.   The Homewood staff is excellent. They've gone out of their way to assist me on several occasions.   In terms of value, I'd rate the Homewood over the Residence Inn and Courtyard. My company has contracts with all three and the Homewood has offered us the best nightly rate.  In terms of areas that need a bit of improvement:  * The fitness room is spacious -- but the equipment is old. Comparatively, this seems par for the course at the business hotels in the area. The Residence Inn and Courtyard fitness rooms may even be slightly worse. I don't get this.   * The breakfast is adequate, but limited. Here I'd give the Residence Inn the edge - fresh scrambled eggs and more variety.  * The Internet can be a bit sketchy depending on room location and isn't the fastest. There also have been at least 3 nights that I stayed during which the hotel experienced an Internet outage. This hasn't happened lately -- but as a business traveler, this is a deal breaker.

The room cleaners aren't very detail oriented, forgetting things like replacing towels and coffee supplies consistently.  I certainly wouldn't avoid this hotel - it's actually very good - it's just not as good as other Homewood Suites.  I will say that it's quite difficult to get to, as a Costco is between it and the nearest main road, requiring you to drive all the way around it.

There was even paper towels and a package of popcorn for snacking on!   I loved the fact that there were separate thermostat controls in the sitting area and in the bedroom. We found these wall units to be pretty quiet. There was also a lighted fan above the bed in the bedroom.should this be a preference as well.

The cheesy casserole dish, Canadian bacon and hash browns were really surprisingly very good. The fruit was freshly cut (not processed), we could have had the options of waffles, toast, bagels, muffins, cereal, yogurt,etc but could not manage this after the casserole. I was impressed to see how the staff kept the dining area tidy and seemed to be cleaning all the time.   There is a small swimming pool (looked good for laps), small gym area with 2 treadmills etc., a business area and even a putting green that is accessible in a middle courtyard in the hotel.

On a longer trip, I really would've appreciated the kitchen facilities, but the fridge got some use. The pillows weren't particularly comfortable, but the bed was otherwise fine. Our room had a separate toilet/shower room, so someone could get at the sink while the other person was… not using the sink. The curtains did not quite close, letting in quite a lot of light from the Bread Factory next door. Fortunately, the coat hangers were removable (always a bonus) and had trouser clips on them, so two of them were pressed into service as light-blockers. The only real downside to my stay was that the automated wakeup call went off at 5AM each morning. The message was weird, so I didn't understand what it was the first day. The front desk gentleman on the second day had no response other than to say that I was down for a 5AM wakeup call, which I had definitely not requested. Next time, I'll check as I check in.

The towels were plentiful (although typical motel quality).

I recommend to those who have long business trips. Here are the reasons:  1. Convenient location: it takes less than 5 minutes to drive to our office. The most important is there is no traffic jam in this route.I need to go to different site of our office but they are both very near. One of them even is within walking distance.   2. Full function kitchen: I really love this kitchen. I can shop at the supermarket and do anything I like. Just feel as I still live in my country.  3. Good service: they offer a lot of unique services, like shuttle bus to office and pick up from the office. This is wonderful for those who not driving. The driver is very nice. He points me a route (GPS does not know this route)that is very near and no jam.   4. Sales Manager Nidhi Kapoor is so helpful. You know when you book a business trip, sometimes you can not decide the exact date for checking in and checking out. It depends on when your trip is approved. But the hotel must be booked with fixed date,sometimes credit card guarantee needed. Nidhi Kapoor helps me on making this booking. It is very flexible. I just told her the estimated date. She also offers a lot of restaurant coupons and a welcome gift kit. It is so sweat.   5. Dinner for free: although I cook myself due to different food preference. This hotel does provide dinner FOR FREE on working days. The menu changed every day and the food has a large variety. This is so great for those who just completing a whole day work, isn't it?  6. The price is very reasonable especially for a long stay(Ask Nidhi for help if you need).
 
 
 Room Tip:  Contact Nidhi for help booking if you have a travel plan but the date is not finalized.

We wouldn't have minded if it was only 1 or 2, but there was a swarm of them flying all over the place. We got grossed out and skipped it. We went back the next morning for breakfast and the fruit flies were still there. My husband thought I was exaggerating about them, but he saw what I was talking about. They were still all over the place. We went back each morning of our stay and they were still there. We were upset about it because we were looking forward to the free breakfast each morning, too. We had to go out and buy our own cereal and eat in our room. They were still flying around when everything was cleaned up. Finally, on the day before we left, we spoke with the front desk about it.

174194956,markham\ca\181720\775037\174194956.html,Homewood Suites by Hilton Toronto-Markham,"Perhaps we got shafted due to our 'free' stay using Hilton honors points, perhaps it was just my bad luck, but my family and I did not have a 5 star experience at all in this hotel!  I will start by stating that I am a Hilton Diamond member and have stayed in numerous Hilton locations throughout my business travels. This hotel was certainly not a fun pleasant experience for my family and I.  We arrived early in the evening and check in was relatively straight forward, quick and simple - just the way I like it. I did notice the lobby area was jam packed with people for what I had assumed was appetizer hour (which I later found that the hotel in fact offered a full dinner for the guests on Monday through Thursday).  There were some luggage carts that I used to help move my family luggage and suits into the room. Using them was clearly a bit awkward since the carts were quite large compared to the rather narrow hallways in this hotel. I was always under the fear of running over my kids or other people!  We finally got to our floor and the first thing that hit me getting off the elevator was the light smell of decomposed garbage. I'm not sure if the compactor was nearby or if it was because the carpets were dirty but in any case it certainly set our impressions right away. (FYI we were on the 5th floor)  Upon seeing the room, my first impression was...that's it? This is a suite in a 'suburbia' hotel? The room in my opinion was decidedly small for a family of four. It almost was if they took a regular hotel room and put a false wall through the middle to force separate living and bedroom areas. This is Markham, not downtown Toronto! Couldn't they have designed this place to be more roomier? Our whole family felt that we were constantly bumping into each other in these very close quarters - and we are not big people. Perhaps they should lose a table and single chair to at least make the place a bit more roomy? With the sofa bed deployed, there just isn't enough room to even walk around the bed to properly get the bed sheets tucked in! I also found myself pushing the office chair and coffee table/Ottoman into the tiny foyer area since there just was no other place to hide them! What irked me even more is when I looked at the fire escape diagram on the back of the hotel room door, I noticed that my room was definitely one of the smaller rooms in the hotel. Is this how this hotel treats it's Diamond level members or just the 'free night' folks?  The room also had a very strong pungent smell of vinegar which we later tracked to the air conditioner unit near the window. Perhaps that's what they use to keep the AC free of mold? Honestly there has to be better ways...Vinegar is not an ideal cleaning agent for public areas!  The bathroom counter area was nice enough if not a bit high for the kids. The toilet was annoying. Woe be it if you're a man, as the toilet lid refused to sit up! I certainly hope that our room was the exception and not the norm on this as this served to annoy the 3 males in our family to no end over our 5 night stay! Water pressure was average and the shower head was good.  The next morning, when we went to the breakfast area, it frankly felt like a scrummage. Every family for themselves! Resources and food were limited during the busy times and they were not being refreshed fast enough. Make sure you send someone down earlier to get your group a table or else it's standing room only! Want a waffle? Be prepared to wait at least 15 minutes IN LINE for your turn! Have kids, want fruit loops - make sure to ask the very busy food staff as other families tended to hoard what few were put out. The food selection itself was generous compared to other Homewood Suites I've been to...that is when there was food available due to the throngs of hungry people. Needless to say, after 2 breakfasts of 'fighting' for food for my family we decided to just head out for breakfast for the remainder of our stay given the plethora of great food options in the area. (HWY 7 has tons of great restaurants and food courts)  On the 2nd night, both our keys demagnetized. Maybe this was bad luck, but as experienced travelers, we always take the regular precautions (don't put it the cards near cell phones and electronics etc). I have this sneaking suspicion that in the haste to check us in, the front desk probably only programmed the cards for 1 night. Normally this isn't a big deal, but coming back late from a wedding with tired kids and getting stuck in a foul smelling hallway isn't how I want my evening to end.  The hotel does offer a free dinner on M-Th nights which is generous. But after all I had been through here, I have to wonder if it's to compensate for all of it's aforementioned deficiencies?  All in all, if you are a Hilton Diamond member and are looking for a 'points' stay, we have had a much better experience down the street at the Hilton Suites on Hwy 7. The rooms feel more spacious and the overall property is nicer and better maintained.

BTW, the hotel wouldn't loan us a rollaway--citing space concerns, how ironic--so we brought our own cot for our son. Our two daughters on the sofabed found it extremely uncomfortable. When we required extra towels, kleenex & soap, service was prompt and friendly. Breakfast was abundant, tasty but busy.

Since my brother and I are hilton gold and diamond members we prefer hilton properties and when traveling with our family, I typically look for Homewood suites for the extra space and amenities. Compared to other Homewood suites we've stayed in, this one was newer and the furniture was modern. The size of the suite was quite small however so a family with 2 small rambunctious children may feel cramped as we did...fortunately we had 2 other suites with relatives across the hall so we were able to bounce around.  Pros: full complimentary hot breakfast is adequate and their indoor pool, while small, it's indoors and a comfortable temperature. The location is near a costco and within walking distance to a couple of nice asian restaurants. It was also very convenient to major highways and roads when driving around. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Cons: we had the misfortune of having some pests in our room.

The meals and ambience provided are excellent if not at the level of a luxury hotel, such as the Hilton Markham & Spa down the road.

From what I saw from the menu, they have a salad bar and one hot entree.  The suites there are so nice, with a fully equipped kitchen. They even give you one bag of complimentary popcorn every day. The bedroom and the living area each has its own digital climate control panels and LCD TV's. High speed internet is also complimentary.

They wanted us comfortable! The one bedroom suite we selected was spotless and fully equipped. Fluffy towels, and six pillows which is so rare! I have a great deal of difficulty of sleeping, averaging 4 hours on a good night. Last night I managed to get 7! I think partly due to a pre bed swim. The pool is totally clean, salt water. There is easy access for seniors. I also need to add that anyone with anyone with a circluation issue, will love this water! Free breakfast and dinner are also included in the rate!! There is no exterior sound, and as the bedroom is at the back of the unit, no sounds from the hall penetrate. So, best bang for your buck, and you are not compromising on any quality.

On the plus side: comfy beds, great shower pressure, nice breakfast staff, good location, decent size rooms. On the down side: Housekeeping cleaned but forgot our towels one day. We got back to the hotel with an hour and a half to shower, dress, and make it to our dinner reservation. Went down to front desk to get towels and was told that they would be sent up to us. No towels came after 20 minutes waiting so I grabbed some towels from the pool area. They were a little better than dish rags. When we got back at 1:00am, towels were there. The next morning, we were jolted out of our sleep at 7:45am by some kind of drum performance in the courtyard. (Our 2nd floor room faced the courtyard.) We called the front desk later that day to express our displeasure and to ensure the same would not happen the next morning. We were told that there was a wedding party staying at the hotel and this was part of their ceremony. We were told there was no manager or assistant manager on duty. The front desk person said she would ask one of the guests if there would be a repeat and get back to us. She didn't, so we had to call again. Upon check out, we were offered 2 bottles of water and a small bag of chips to compensate for the inconvenience. I completed the hotel survey that was sent via email but never heard from anyone. Just make sure you get a room far away from any wedding festivities if you stay here!

We decided to book here, since it's about a 20 minute drive to both the Toronto Zoo and the Ontario Science Centre.  The Room -  We stayed in the King Bed Suite with a whirl pool which offered plenty of room for the 5 of us (with an added cot). The kids loved sitting in the whirl pool watching TV (I would recommend for the extra $$).   There is a small kitchenette included (stove top only, no oven) and they provide the basic cutlery and dishes. There's a Costco as well as a Longo's close by so you can stock up the fridge.  We would have liked to listen to music but the radio in the room was disconnected (so the alarm would only beep, no music), We checked the TV for some music stations but there weren't any - however you could pay $9.99 for 120 minutes which to me explained why the clockradio didn't play music.   I did find the TV a bit small for the room, a 26"" I think, but we really weren't there to watch TV.  All things considered, the room was clean, the sheets were fresh and it was a good space.  Breakfast Buffet -  I liked the idea that we had breakfast included and since it ran from 6-10am we thought we would have enough time for all of us to eat. Unfortunately if you don't get there before 8:00am it's pretty picked over. They do restock items, but it can take awhile. On the Sunday we went down at 9:30am thinking we could just grab some coffee and muffins and go, but were disappointed to find that there was absolutely nothing left, including coffee. We were told by the staff that they were not allowed to make any more coffee after 9:30am. Very disappointing considering the coffee in the room tasted like weak tea.  Pool -  The pool was quite small (max of about 25 people) but it's heated and again the kids loved it so no complaints.",4,positive

On our Sunday morning (8:30am), people were waiting in line for food trays to be refilled, and other food items to be replenished. There were a few disappointments. We requested a crib for our toddler and called before arriving to ensure the room was ready with a crib for late arrival. What we found instead was a playpen with a hard board base and no cushioning or comfort. The receptionist speculated that guests on extended stays had the cribs and there was none left. I would have rather been told there was no crib, then have a playpen substituted as a bed for a good night sleep. We placed 2 sofa cushions in the playpen, fitted with a mattress cover (we brought) to put some comfort in this playpen. The king sized bed was very comfortable; however, the sofa bed was hugely uncomfortable and I would not use it again as a sleeping option. The bathroom was exceptionally clean and large; however, there was no separate door from the main bedroom (if you need to turn on the light), and the toilet was behind another door next to the tub. The sink and counter are so unusually high, our 4 year old still could not reach the taps to wash hands or brush teeth even with the step we brought.

237748683,markham\ca\181720\775037\237748683.html,Homewood Suites by Hilton Toronto-Markham,"I've been to this hotel several times before, as well as another Homewood Suites in London.   We stayed for two nights this past weekend: October 31-November 2. We stayed in the one bedroom suite room with a King bed.   An ongoing issue I've experienced at both hotels stems from their heating/cooling system. It is in desperate need of an overhaul. In this suite there are two units: one in the bedroom and one in the living room area. Both are individually controlled by thermostats on the walls in each respective room.  We had to absolutely crank the temperature (to 79+) to have the units click on and start blowing hot air. If the hot air was off the room cooled down VERY quickly. This meant that the room was either very hot or freezing cold (there was a ridiculously strong draft blowing into the room from underneath the unit in the living room. I imagine this is where the hot air was going). At times, the unit in the living room would only blow cold air. For $129 a night plus tax, I'd like to be comfortable and not scrambling to grab a sweater or take it off. This also had an enormous impact on our sleep for both nights of our two-night stay.   The cleanliness/overall state of the room left a bit to be desired. We found some food on the floor next to the couch, the ceiling fan in the bedroom was caked with dust (some of it flew off onto our bed when we turned it on in an effort to distribute some of the warm air), the paint was peeling on the door frame, there were marks and scuffs on several walls, the lights flickered in the bathroom area...the room had the feel of needing a slight makeover. Nothing drastic, mind you, but it's certainly showing its age.  One of the lamps in the living area did not work at all. On the first night, the bigger of the two burners on the stove didn't work and then we realized the element had come unplugged from inside the stove. It also randomly stopped working the following morning while I was in the middle of making breakfast! The next issue we experienced was with the televisions. My boyfriend and I brought our own DVD/blu-ray player (our Playstation 3) in order to watch movies. The unit hooks up with an HDMI input. We tried this on BOTH televisions and it simply would not work. We would get a fuzzy image on the screen for about 5 seconds and then it was just static. Since we tried this on both televisions, we assumed it must have been an issue with the Playstation itself or the HDMI cable: it was not. We tested both when we got home and everything worked fine. We have brought this with us every time we've gone to a Homewood Suites and this is the first time we've had this issue.  We asked the front desk for a DVD player and they obliged--which was great...unfortunately the unit they lent us did not have a remote control. The unit itself had no select button, fast forward or rewind.  Finally, the staff. The woman who checked us in on Friday night was absolutely WONDERFUL. I cannot sing her praises enough and I only wish I remembered her name (it was about 6:30pm when we arrived on the 31st of October)...she was kind, friendly, explained everything to us very clearly and made the effort to call our room within an hour of arrival to see if we needed anything.  However, upon check out, the staff we dealt with were not as friendly. My boyfriend had called down on the Saturday evening to request late check-out the following day. We were told we could get 12pm and to call back the following morning to see if it could be extended to 1pm. We obliged and called back the next morning and the woman we spoke to was a bit rude about our request. At one point she said ""I GUESS I can extend it to 1pm."" We were not trying to be bothersome...my partner and I don't live together and we aren't able to get away to have time with one another very often, so we really cherish and value every minute we can get. At around 12:30, a staff member called to ask when we'd be leaving and she thought we were supposed to leave at 12? I felt very rushed and explained that we had been told we could leave at 1pm.  Of all our stays at these hotels, this was definitely the worst. We were planning to go back for New Year's of this year but now I'm not sure either of us want to. We may end up at the Staybridge Suites instead. Disappointing.",3,negative
238211456,markham\ca\181720\775037\238211456.html,Homewood Suites by Hilton Toronto-Markham,"I don't think my review is a big surprise for the staff. Had to talk to them more than I ever desire on my trips. The good: the bed is comfortable and the towels are decent.The check in was easy but it was prepaid. The bad: where do I start... The hallways are noisy at night. The shower door is cheap and leaking. The bathroom floor is slippery. The toilet vs the bathroom door is annoying. Whoever designed and approved the whole suite/room wasn't terribly concerned about the guests. The room is small, TV picture is of somewhat poor quality. The sofa probably came from Salvation Army. There is some smell in the room, couldn't understand what..  The kitchen. If you want to cook, find another hotel. We found 3 knives, 2 or 3 forks and spoons. The pot handle was about to fall off so I had to screw it tight with a knife. The coils on the stove are tilted and crooked. The kitchen table is disproportionately huge. Mind you it's a regular size table but because the kitchen is so cramped it's closing the entrance to the room. We brought that huge luggage cart in to the room and got stuck because it was no space left to walk around. By that ridiculous table you find 2 very big and heavy chairs. Sitting on one will bring your back toward the sink, on the other one is to the opposite wall. When you need to stand up and try to maneuver around you move the chairs.. Here comes the best part! Yesterday night we heard some chair moving above us, today I've got a phone call at midnight that people from the room below can't sleep because we are moving the chairs.. First of, don't patronize the guests with lecture at midnight about being inconsiderate because my kid moved it once ,standing up after finishing snack before bed. It's heavy! There is no other way or space in this ""kitchen"" to do it. Put a decent insulation or a rug on the floor or supply different chairs. God forbid you came back late or hungry after hours. Don't dream to use kitchen because you'll be reprimanded by the night clerk. Just when you need him!  The first night, waited for extra hangers some very extra time.. The second night -waited for bathroom towels 15-20 min after calling the front desk for 15 min to no avail. The room service forgot to bring them in the first place, the night rep said he was busy.. Please don't expect being served promptly even if you stand there wet and naked for half an hour.  Then my room wasn't cleaned at all! Yes, the ""Ssshh"" sign was inside the room! The housekeeping is lazy. The guy who barged into my room in the evening to pick up the dirty towels told us they didn't clean every day. Sooo..can I pay you every other day as well? The breakfast is subpar but you won't die.  The keys got demagnetized and it took 2 or 3 trips downstairs and one grouchy clerk upstairs to open the door. Yes, I know how to insert the key! One thing that really annoyed me this time is common courtesy and English comprehension by the staff, especially the male part of it that gets very defensive. Even apologies sound like favor. My English isn't perfect by I don't answer a the phone with little understanding what was being sad or asked or communicate with general public face to face. Please train your staff to be proud of being part of Hilton brand and level of customer service.",2,negative

Staff here are incredibly friendly and courteous, always a nice greeting and immediate response to any questions or requests.  This facility obviously places great emphasis on customer service and satisfaction. It showed with the staff we encountered and the proud displays of their many awards.....so I thought I would pass along a few helpful hints/suggestions:  - bathrooms, an exhaust fan would be a good idea  - also in bathrooms....men urinate standing up.....adjust the seats so that they will stay up when  placed up!  - pool area is spacious and warm....but lacks a hot tub  - wifi is a little slow and weak, crashed several times. You may want to consider strengthening  your service  Otherwise, we had a great time and a very enjoyable stay. I would definitely return here any time.

The hotel is clean and quiet and the rooms were spacious. Morning breakfast after a lively night before was much appreciated, not just a continental either. The staff at check in and out were very nice. Great proximity to the local highway made this an excellent choice.

293778217,markham\ca\181720\775037\293778217.html,Homewood Suites by Hilton Toronto-Markham,"My wife and I stayed at this property for 3 nights as a short getaway. Check in was done in advance on line which allowed me to pick my room based on what was available. At check in it was a matter of just picking up my keys. The room was a king suite which had the bedroom separate from a living space and a kitchen. There was not much more you could ask for, a comfortable space to sit before going to bed and a full fridge, microwave, cutlery, etc if you needed, we did not but I love the convenience of the fridge and microwave. The location of the hotel was not too bad 10 minutes north of highway 401 and really right off of highway 404. We were only about 25 minutes from downtown without traffic which can be an issue most times, but even with that we made good time. We asked for a restaurant recommendation one night and we were given a great little historic area Unionville10 minutes from the hotel which was just perfect. the breakfast in the morning was more than sufficient to get you started and keep you going until lunch. The breakfast area was clean and well maintained. My only puzzlement was that there were real dishes and cutlery the first morning and on the weekend they were replaced by paper and plastic. As well they had a waffle maker the first two days and the third it was gone.  All in all this hotel had really everything you could need for a short or extended stay, but most importantly to us when we travel is a clean room and bathroom which they delivered. The kitchen area is a bonus. You won't go wrong by choosing this hotel it was an excellent rate, nice staff and overall a great place to stay.
 
 
 Room Tip:  Choose a room not facing the highway for a slight quieter sleep but still not an issue either way.

After a 4 and half hour drive from Sudbury to Pickering and then another half an hour from Pickering to Markham,it was 12:30am, we were full of stress and needed to sleep. At first we had troubles getting into the hotel but that's probably because the staff were actually doing their job. We finally got into the room and were blown away from the sheer beauty of the room. Sure it doesn't have the view of a life time but who needs that kind of view when your bed feels like a cloud and you have free wifi. Plus, the shower is beautiful and they have a pool. The only problem I had with this hotel was that it said it had a jacuzzi and I could not find the jacuzzi (didn't really look to be honest, it was probably hiding somewhere). Other than that, a perfect hotel. I would recommend this to anyone staying in or around Markham.",5,positive

Check in was smooth but a little confusing since we asked to be close to our family but when I asked if we could the front desk person said they aren't even at this hotel. So I called them and they were sure since they already checked in, when I went back it was like ""ok you are right, I didn't look to see if they were checked in or not"".  We used the BBQ out side for our supper and they were good. When we went to our room to get some more food our keys wouldn't work. I told the front desk that the batteries need to be changed in the door. So the lady called maintenance to take the master key and let us in. Kinda useless if our keys don't work. It took over an hr to figure this out. So needless to say our burgers were done......When I complained I got a smile and an oops....not a good way to handle the situation. I mentioned something to the manager at check out and it was the same way.  The breakfast both mornings was good and there was plenty.

When the error was quickly discovered, a staff member who happened to be in the hall at the time, called down to the desk, got my correct room number and helped me with my luggage up to my room.   The hotel was clean and well staffed. My suite of rooms was large enough and comfortable enough. The small kitchenette was well equipped, enabling me to prepare my meals - the dishwasher a great plus! There were a few times that I took advantage of the breakfast provided in the hotel, but one had to get down there early to get the best benefit from it.  I have to say the bed was extremely comfortable, and I slept well each night. The location was an easy drive to the Shouldice Clinic, and to a nearby grocery store.  The front desk staff got to recognize me very quickly and often greeted me on entry and departure.  Most importantly, I felt very safe, even when walking late at night from the car to the hotel.  For me, it was a good experience during a difficult time.

It was right off the expressway and easy to get to.   The hotel was quite clean, including our room, the lobby and the breakfast area. I liked the simple yet modern decor throughout the hotel. Our room was very spacious, which is one main reason I like Homewood Suites. While we didn't use the kitchen for our one-night stay, it was well-equipped for a hotel room kitchen. Our room was clean and well-maintained. However, our one complaint is that we found a bed skirt just underneath the comforter on our bed. I kept getting tangled in the bed linens at night and had no idea why until we discovered this interesting addition on top of our bed the next morning.  Unfortunately, our room was on the ground floor near to the elevator. While I am not sure if the noise we heard was the elevator or some kind of large heating and cooling machine, this cycling on an off kept my husband awake much of the night. We did not hear noise from other people or rooms, however.  The free breakfast was good including fruit, pastries, cereal, 2 hot dishes and make-your-own waffles. It was well-stocked and included options for both me and my husband.  As a Hilton Honors member, we had free wi-fi and extra pillows in our room as per my request filed online.  While we thoroughly enjoyed staying in downtown Toronto, this was an excellent alternative en route and it saved us money on the hotel rate, and included free parking and breakfast saving us even more. We would definitely stay again.

With that said, the room met our needs. We made use of the fridge and full kitchen as well. The staff at this hotel are wonderful! Everyone we ran into was very helpful.

It's about 30 min from downtown, which is not bad on weekends since traffic is okay. Check in was efficient. The young guy gave us the key and we quickly checked in. He was a little cold. It would be better if he greeted the guests more friendly and made us feel more welcome. The room was good size. Although they call it a suite, it was basically one large room with a sofa on one end and king bed on the other. Room was fine. Ours was on the first floor right next to the pool. We had to be careful walking out cause the floor was frequently wet in the corridor due to people coming out from the pool. We were not in our room most of the time so the noise didn't bother us. However, the sound insulation is pretty bad. We can hear loud noises coming from our neighboring room. I talked to the front desk and the guy called our neighbors. They cooperated and we heard them no more. The breakfast was complimentary and it was adequate, with warm foods.   The hotel is close to a number of shops including Costco. There's also a popular Chinese/Japanese buffet place called Dragon Legend across the main road. It is not the typical buffet place you come across. We did it before we checked in and we were glad because it was so close.

Overall, the hotel is attractive and well maintained, with the kind of large, well-appointed, functional guestrooms that you would expect from Homewood Suites. The pool and exercise room were adequate -- neither fabulous nor disappointing, but certainly sufficient for our needs. Much less impressive were the complimentary food offerings -- I'm referring mainly to the evening social, but also the breakfast to some extent. I have stayed at many different hotels that offer food as part of the value proposition (e.g., Drury, Country Inn, Hilton) and I found the food at this Homewood Suites to be wanting. The so-called 'evening social' was particularly disappointing, consisting as it did of lettuce, salad dressing, soup, a few raw vegetables, candied nuts and a modest cheese plate (there may have been some kind of tomato salad as well, but the bowl was empty and it was not replenished). Breakfast was a bit better, but still less in terms of variety than I have come to expect from this category of hotel. (Budget cuts, perhaps?) For many, this is a differentiator that sets one chain apart from another. In my view, Homewood Suites needs to seriously up its game on the food front.",3,negative

The breakfast room is on the 14th floor and while the breakfast is passable, the views are quite nice.

The room was very clean, modern and everything in order. The suites are all located on the top floors with the breakfast room on the 14th floor. Our king bed was great and the room quiet. It was the Easter weekend so the hotel wasn't busy which suited us just fine. You need a car to stay here. There's little within comfortable walking distance. The hotel is conveniently located next to the 404 and the 407 toll highway and Woodbine links you to anywhere in Markham.  The Courtyard Toronto Markham Northeast is just below the TownePlace Suites. I was told this was the first such combination hotel for Marriott in North America.  The only real improvement needed in my opinion was the breakfast. There were two hot plates offered. The first morning it was pancakes & scrambled eggs and the second it was sausages & French toast. A strange combination really. The coffee needs improvement too. Everything else was fine.  Daily parking is $4 tax included either outside or in a parking garage. Not bad considering what we've paid elsewhere.  Stayed here April 3 & 4.

The rooms are the perfect size for relaxing and catching up with work, and the mini kitchen is just about the right size to fix up a quick dish if you're a bit hungry! The security system in the elevators is wonderful. Having to scan your keycard before choosing which floor you would like to access gives travellers a peace of mind knowing that not any random person can simply visit a floor. This hotel's fitness center is one of the very few I've been in that offers yoga balls for its customers, so I was pretty amazed when I saw yoga balls in a fitness center in a Marriott Towneplace location. It would be a lot better if this hotel made it clear that breakfast for Towneplace residents is on the 14th floor, and the Courtyard Bistro is in the lobby. However, there are baggage carts in the hallways, which can be a serious fire hazard. Having to pay a petty fee for parking is not exactly fantastic, but it's negligible. The parking structure should have more lightning, and there should be more signs pointing to where the entrance to the hotel from the parking structure. Honestly, the parking structure is creepy at night, and with the lack of security, you don't exactly feel safe. If you're arriving late to the hotel, parking near the front of the hotel is a much better decision.

Examples: - the rooms are clean. They get properly cleaned every day by friendly staff! Yet, I preferred an extra cleaning of the drawers. In less then 5 minutes my drawers got an extra ""clean session""... with a smile! - I practise triathlon and asked if I can store my bike in the hotel. In 5 minutes a safe & sound solution was found....and..yes, with a smile! - Ravina noticed I liked the outdoors and friendly pointed out to me a rewarding hiking trail ""rattlesnake point trail"" - I prefer more accommodation on the upper floors -and although the hotel was almost fully booked - Sarah searched until she found a proper solution for me...with a smile!

Arriving at this one, ti appeared to have once been a Holiday Inn that was taken over and completely gutted; shared with a Courtyard, this is exactly what you would expect from a completely refurbished property, clean, efficient, practical.  Location was perfect as family was nearby. Except for service issues, this would happily have been a 4 rating, but the property management did not believe in warning guests that during the booked stay would be the monthly fire alarm testing...  Aside from coming in on a red-eye international flight, I was hoping to sleep in after a long night of travel, only to find signs posted about a fire alarm test the next day at 10:30-11:30. Trying to combine a little business with my family visit, I scheduled a call at 11:30 that I was going to take from my room. Of course you can guess that the test did not actually start until 11:40, and ran through almost 1:00, allowing for a missed opportunity to get that hour of sleep, in addition to having my work call destroyed by a screeching fire alarm that made any attempt at a phone cal from anywhere on the premises impossible.  First and foremost, safety and security are important, as is the system testing. My issue here is that Marriott provides a medium on their web site for properties to warn business guests of possible interruptions (like renovations under progress). A monthly fire alarm test should easily have been noticed to guests, so we can plan accordingly if we want to sleep during the day. The same is true for the test happening when posted; if you set a time window, meet it.",3,negative

I did not partake of the daily breakfast but my husband and son did. I was told they were very basic and not many choices. We stay at Marriot all the time, so it was disappointing. On the other hand, it is a longer term stay facility with a kitchen, so maybe they figure not many people will want a breakfast?  My only pet peeve, is being a rewards member, they ask for your 'preferences'. Why is it they never listen to them and utilize the information they have for your stay?!? We ask for extra towels and extra pillows and they NEVER do that! We always have to call down to ask for towels. Then... (like many hotels) they ask you to hang up your towels if you want to reuse them (to be eco friendly) and yet they take them and replace them anyway! Ugh!

Bottom line up front… a thoroughly enjoyable stay in every respect.   The two brands share common reception desk, fitness facility, swimming pool, bistro dining area and business conference meeting rooms and facilities. Floors 9 and up are TownePlace Suites, with each room or suite fitted with full size refrigerators and kitchen facilities to accommodate extended stayers.

Basically, the 'suites' are really just hotel rooms converted. We had 2 double queen beds, quite comfortable, but they took up so much room there was only a 'desk chair' to sit in. WIFI was free.   It has a mini kitchen with fridge/freezer, microwave, tiny dishwasher, coffee maker, hot top, utensils, and dishes for 4. The fridge had the previous guest's food in it...they were up to clean it quickly and very apologetic, but it did concern us. Bathroom is very tiny.   Can't imagine staying here for an extended stay. The king bed room is similar in size but does have a sofa to sit on which would be better.  The parking is $4 a night, but they don't tell you this on check in...or that you have to register your car license with the front desk. They also didn't tell us we get a free breakfast on the 14th floor when you are in the TownePlace portion (Courtyard guests have to pay $13 for breakfast on the lobby floor). We went to the TownePlace breakfast room but it was full of people and had a very limited menu. Because of the dirty fridge problem they gave us a free breakfast in the lobby, and it was much better.  There's not much in the way of hotel choices nearby but if you want a true suites hotel I suggest the Hilton Suites at Warden & Highway 7, about 5 minutes away, as they have nice dining rooms an great shopping mall across the street. Probably more money.  For dinner we went up Woodbine to CARMANENA and had a very nice dinner.

329321219,markham\ca\181720\7839627\329321219.html,TownePlace Suites Toronto Northeast/Markham,"Had the best stay at this hotel. from Nov 13-15, 2015. We were in the Toronto area for our kids Taekwondo tournament and chose this hotel based on the rating, smoke-free and convenience of having kitchen to save money on meals. The suite was spotless, the hotel staff were very friendly, helpful and went above and beyond their duties. We have kids that have allergies and the hotel made sure the room was feather-free and cleaned using unscented, allergy-safe cleaners. We were able to check in a few hours early so the kids had lots of time in the pool (which was very clean and just he right temperature). The breakfast was fresh and delicious with a good assortment and was kept replenished (no waiting). When we returned to the hotel from the tournament, one of the staff noticed the medal on one of the kids and congratulated him. We mentioned that all 3 kids that competed won medals. A short time after we got back to our room there was a knock on the door and a guest services member delivered a gift bag with some treats and a congratulatory note from all the staff for the kids. They were so excited and grateful. We were so very impressed with the level of commitment the staff has for their guests and the attention to detail is phenomenal. Many of the people in our group that stayed at other hotels were so impressed and jealous of our hotel and staff. Any time we stay in the Greater Toronto Area, we (ans our other group members) will be staying right here even if we have to drive a bit further to attend functions!!!",5,positive

The room and bathroom were clean. The bed was very comfortable.

We will definitely stay here again. I highly recommend this hotel.,5,positive

This hotel is located in the north of the city. To get to the downtown you will need to get a bus. And staff is very kind and always try to help. The breakfast is always the same, and for me who stayed 1 week it is not good, always the same egg, and pork sausage, it is very restrict.

345984875,markham\ca\181720\7839627\345984875.html,TownePlace Suites Toronto Northeast/Markham,"We found this to be a very good value. We stayed in a room with two queens. It was a bit tight for our family (two adults, two kids) with only one chair, so we'd sit on the beds when in the room. But this was not a surprise as we knew the room configuration in advance. The room was perfectly clean and up-to-date. And the small kitchen was actually usable. The breakfast included was fine -- make-your-own waffles, oatmeal, bagels, sausage, eggs, yogurt -- not amazing, but enough selection to please most. The staff was very nice and pleasant throughout the building - front desk, breakfast, housekeeping. The pool was nice and warm. Nice work-out facility. A small selection of food and drinks for sale next to the front desk, so you could get something 24-hours a day. Near the highway, but didn't have any highway noise. Location is quite removed from downtown, so if you are in Toronto as a tourist make sure you understand the location. But our room rate was 1/3 to 1/2 of downtown rates. I thought all-in-all was a very good value and I'd stay there again.",4,positive
350508188,markham\ca\181720\7839627\350508188.html,TownePlace Suites Toronto Northeast/Markham,"My first impressions of this split Marriott hotel north of Toronto was that it would be a quiet, average stay in a boring part of town. Upon checking in, I saw that the hotel was rated an 8,9/10 in 2015, which gave me a good feeling. The lobby is simple, clean and nicely decorated and the staff was excellent!   I booked a suite with a King bed. The high floor was superb and the elevator was fast. The hotel has 14 floors and the higher you are the less you can hear the street noise. The same can't be said for the ice machine though...  If you do book here make sure you're far away from the ice machine. It's an older model and runs all day and night and when it runs it runs loudly!  My room was smaller than I expected and it just went down hill from there.   The BAD: Too small for a long term stay, no lock on the bathroom door, no hooks in the bathroom to dry towels or clothes, the TV shut off randomly every time we watched it (and sleep function wasn't active), TV remote only worked 15% of the time, the tub was too small for even 1 person.  The GOOD: Full kitchen in the suite that includes a stove. Nice flat screen TV, Great water pressure! Free Wifi, great view of the city, good lighting.  The breakfast, although free, was pretty bad. The eggs tasted like nothing and had a tofu texture. They were inedible. Sausage patties was gross and that's it for hot breakfast. No hashbrowns, no beans, no potatoes, no bacon! I stuck to the cereal, fruit and toast. TIP: Breakfast is served on the 14th floor, so if you want access to coffee, tea and hot chocolate all day it's best if you're close to or on that floor.  The pool was quite large, but what makes it suffer is the layout. The room is huge but most of the space is wasted. There is plenty of room for a hot tub, but there isn't one. Just lots of empty deck. Patio chairs were nice and big though. There is a lack of relaxing atmosphere. They need new lighting to make it more relaxing. Also, the ceiling is so low it feels like you're swimming in a basement, which doesn't make you want to stay for too long. Change rooms were tiny, only one shower and one toilet. The gym is small as well, but should be good enough for a simple work out regimen.  The hotel lacks a nice restaurant. Instead they have a 'Starbucks-like' Bistro that is only open at 5pm and serves sandwiches and salads. Not very good for dinner so we ate out.  LOCATION: It's terrific! Close to major roads and highways. There are many bars and restaurants within walking distance and a Karaoke place across the street (we didn't go because it's a rip off there). There is a ton of parking (covered and uncovered) and it's affordable.  OVERALL: It may seem like I have a lot of complaints, but the hotel is fine. However, if you're going for long term you might get cabin fever in the small room and be bored with the pool area.
 
 
 Room Tip:  Keep away from the ice machine

I found the room to be clean and nicely put together. The fridge didn't work...or it did and sounded like a freight train when it went on so I had to un-plug it to go to sleep. Surprised at he fridge as they replaced it just after I checked in. I figure the old one must have sounded like a jet plane. Breakfast supplied was nice. Workout room and pool were clean and located in the lower level...not mentioned in room information. Main Lounge looked nice however didn't use it.

Every morning hitting the swimming pool then grabbing a bite. No issue with the parking, plenty spaces and for a very reasonable fee (5 CAD).

But what makes this an enjoyable breakfast experience was the server Norma. She kept the place so clean and make sure all the fruits are clean and fresh. She will help you anyway she can.

We all had a pleasant experience during our stay last year. However, this year it seems something is off...  Free Breakfast: this hotel is very busy during weekend which gives lot of stress to all the public services (parking, elevator, pool etc) and breakfast. On Friday morning, we are still able to grab a piece of fruit and the serving lady is able to refill the empty trays promptly in the breakfast room. On Saturday morning, the breakfast room is all packed with people and families. There are some guests whose took lot of fruits and foods; however, the hotel should be smart enough knowing the demand for breakfast based on their number of guests. The server lady eventually told us they ran out of fruits and apologized and it is only 9am and the breakfast supposes to end by 10am! If you want their breakfast during the weekend, go as early as you could.   Housekeeping: Our family reserved 4 rooms located on 9th floor and all of us experienced different levels of clumsiness in housekeeping: missing toilet paper and shampoo set, no coffee refills, smelly pillowcase, towel by the sink not on the rack and the corridor has all the dirts which apparently lack of vacuum. Even you left a note with some service requests and a few dollars tips, the money was taken but the service requests were not fulfilled. Since we don't want to use our precious time on complains and waiting for fixes, we kind of live with it.  Our family loves this hotel as it is situated in a very convenient location. The room is large and the room quality is good and comfy. Though the breakfast and housekeeping service seemed to decline, the front desk service is as friendly and professional since first time stay in this hotel.   If people stay there on weekdays,I don't think breakfast will be such a big issue.

We got there in the last hour the restaurant is open and most of the food is gone. The choices are limited for this free breakfast, but if you don't want to drive to another place it is OK. I would still rate our stay as 5-star.

413154601,markham\ca\181720\7839627\413154601.html,TownePlace Suites Toronto Northeast/Markham,My family needed a place to stay due to delay in our new house. We managed to speak with David at the hotel and he showed us around the hotel and took the time to explain to us about the services. We stayed for 5 weeks and our room was on the top floor. Size of the room is good as we were in one of the larger room. The room has a full size fridge and cooktop which is great for my family. Breakfast is also included daily but sometimes the restaurant gets crowded with other families. We ended up having breakfast in our room especially on the weekends. They do have hot sausage and eggs every morning but would like to see more variety if staying there for such a long period. We also ate at their restaurant on the lobby level which is good for a change. Housekeeping did a very good job in cleaning our room. Our room was clean and always have enough shampoo and soap. The maid also help cleaned our kitchen which I think is fantastic. Most of the time we just put everything into the dishwasher. We live in the area so there is not much interaction with front desk during our stay. I must mention one staff who always wears a big smile on her face when we passed by the desk. Her name is Bonnie and she was very pleasant throughout our stay.,5,positive
413558519,markham\ca\181720\7839627\413558519.html,TownePlace Suites Toronto Northeast/Markham,"The hotel was a good location that suited our needs. We didn't want to stay in the city (Toronto), but this provided us a good alternative. The GO Train (we used the Scarborough station) was a great option if you didn't want to drive/park in the city. It was located about 20 minutes from the hotel. We experienced a few issues at the hotel, but it could have been isolated. When we initially arrived, we were told we couldn't check in because the hotel was experiencing a computer malfunction. We drove around for a while and went back (even though we spent a good portion of the day driving to get there). When we finally checked in, the room we were given on the 12th floor didn't open (the lock was not functioning). We were given a different room on the 9th floor fairly quickly. We were locked out of our second room multiple times during our stay due to the lock mechanism not working. To be fair, the staff were quick to fix the problem each time (it was very inconvenient though after long days of touring the Toronto area). The beds were very comfortable and it was nice having a full kitchenette. Although we had a reservation for 4 people, for some reason we were given bath linens every day for only 3 people. Also, the dusting and toilet cleaning appeared to be overlooked. The Queen Studio was nice, but not quite as roomy (for a family of 4) as we thought when making the reservation. The breakfast buffet was ok, but nothing special. Even though we paid for it during our stay with our hotel package, we opted to eat elsewhere after the first morning. There needs to be variety from day to day for people who are on extended stays. The hotel staff was very friendly and the parking (although there is a small fee) is very convenient. The pool and fitness area was great and so was the convenience of the café.",3,negative

It was convenient to our office and I can literally walk to work in less than 15 minutes. It is also close to several local restaurants and have 2 banks right next door. Public transportation is also steps away from the hotel if you want to take the bus. The bus will also connect you to the subway where you can head to downtown Toronto.  I made the initial reservation with David in the sales department. He is very courtesy and provided me with tons of information like getting limousine from the airport to the hotel, bankings information, public transportation.  Hotel room has a king bed and a kitchen which is perfect since my wife was able to do some cooking. There is a supermarket about 15 minutes walk from the hotel and she does her shopping there. Breakfast is also included but we did not eat there every morning, You get tired of the same food after a few days and I wish they can offer something different once in a while.  Hotel also have a laundry room next to the fitness centre and swimming pool. The size of the pool is fairly big comparing to other hotels that I have stayed at. My wifes prefer to do the laundry in the after when there is nobody around. Sometimes it can get very busy on the weekends.  Housekeeping is good as we do not requrie them everyday. Sometimes I just leave the no service sign out becasue we just don't need cleaning everyday. The maids are very efficient and also provided us with extra soap and shampoo.  I have moved out after staying there for 5 weeks but for sure will recommend this to my family and friends.",5,positive

This location was chosen to be near a conference I was attending so it worked for me.   The Bistro has a relatively good menu & comfortable for sitting to eat your meal what ever you choose.

It was nervous to be in a foreign country but the staff at the hotel made me and my family felt like we were leaving at home, Everybody was very friendly and sincerely. Our contact David was especially nice because I have never seen a person in any hotel I stayed at to be so sincere. He sent us numerous emails with all sort of information before we came to Canada. He called us the same evening after we checked in and also followed up with calls throughout our stay. I felt like he was part of my family.  The room is nice and comes with a kitchen which is very helpful for my wife when it comes to cooking. There is also a large fridge for us to store all the food that we got from the supermarket. Hotel supplies the basic cooking utensils. Could be nice if there was a toaster in the room.  Thy have a very large swimming but we didn't use it much. I love the laundry facilities in the basement, I was worry that we need to bring everything out to wash since we don't know how far away that would be.  Breakfast was also included in our room but you get tired after eating there for almost two months. My wife ended up cooking for some mornings as the hotel was busy during the summer. We just don't want to be stuck with so many people at the same time. My son loves the waffle especially since we don't have this kind of machine at home.  I had already told my friends and co-worker to stay at this hotel when they visit Toronto.

The Hotel charged my card with 1 week advance room charges, which was okay. However immediately on completion of 6 days, without intimating me, the balance amount was also charged along with the security deposit. Since I had a pre charged debit card, I had no money left in the card for daily use. When I inquired with the reception, as to why the Security deposit was also deducted without intimation, they said system acts automatically.  Why have a system that is not customer friendly??. The complaint was sent to the Hotel Manager, who had no time to respond, neither called back.  When we asked as to why the same limited breakfast options were being served daily, we were told that for more variety we can buy stuff from outside and cook in the room.   Parking is charged extra.  Other than this, the experience was okay, but may be we would think twice about coming back.

431023729,markham\ca\181720\7839627\431023729.html,TownePlace Suites Toronto Northeast/Markham,"I so wanted this hotel to be 5 star. Upon enteing the suite, which was a one bedroom King handicap accessible. (my daughter is in a wheelchair) it seemed perfect. It went downhill immediately . Turning lights on there was a complete lack of lighting in every room. They were also controlled by both the wall and the lamps. None of them were in sync, which meant in the dark I had to figure out how and where all of the switches were and then find the lamp switches get everything turned on and then I was able to use the light switches on the wall. Maybe not a big deal but if traveling with a person in a power wheelchair a really big deal. The bathroom is located in a room that adjoins the bedroom. There are no windows. The paint is sort of a burnt orange which makes the room dark. we stayed 5 nights. Every day I complained that the light bar in the bathroom had a missing shade and a burnt out bulb. Every day I got an excuse or a pretend come up to fix it with no parts. They lied the entire 5 days. On the morning we were leaving maintenance started bothering us at 8:00 a.m. to fix our bathroom light. At that point I didn't care as we were leaving. I did notice they had gone to Home Depot to purchase a brand new light fixture. That really helped us and I am sure whoever had the room before us either complained or broke it . The Handicap accessible bathroom was a serious accident waiting to happen. My daughter and I almost wiped out giving her a shower as there are no grab bars and only a slippery fold down seat for her to sit down on in the shower. There is a 2 inch collapsible lip to hold the water in the shower. It doesn't work. Then a very slippery tile floor which looks great but functions poorly when trying to transfer a person back to their wheelchair. It took numerous for me to get the floor dry enough to even attempt this. again with no grab bars my body took a beating. The hotel has recently been remodeled 2014 and this may be code to Canada but If I were a wife helping a spouse or if my daughter wasn't so petite at age 26 we would have been seriously injured. Especially with no light to help us see what we were doing.  As to the free breakfast we never even bothered we are night people so I brought along our own food. The kitchen area was satisfactory for breakfast and easy to cook things. Again very poor lighting.  We happened to be there when a youth hockey tournament was being held. The parents were way out of control as were the kids who appeared to be in the 10- 14 year old age group. There is a nice lounge area however they are not open and serve no real food. I asked the person working the counter and the reply was the owner of the hotel is to cheap to keep staff on hand so food could be available.  I think that statement resonates throughout the hotel between not getting a light fixed to a very poorly stocked sundry and frozen food area. I couldn't even buy a real toothbrush there. All of the food or should I say ice cream in the freezers looked old and frost bitten. There was no food to buy like say a Lean Cuisine to take to your room for a quick snack. The rooms had microwaves in them but I am not sure of the purpose.  I did mention the hotel being recently remodeled however in our room the workmanship was shoddy at best. Missing tiles in the bathroom bad layout and just a feeling that it was shoved together made it feel like a much cheaper hotel. I don't like being lied to and that is what the staff did for 6 days and 5 nights. Lies about the lighting in the bathroom about how far the hotel is from Toronto and how much they were going to hold on my credit card. Not user friendly at all. They tied up close to 200.00 U.S. dollars on my card for incidentals. They had nothing to buy or eat . Money grab at best.  The Hotel is part Town Place Suites and part Court Yard Marriott. I have no idea what the Court Yard rooms are. We went from our room to our van for outings. My review is written strictly on our experience,  A giant plus is Woodbine is a good city and I was able to find a Chrysler dealership for some emergency work on my van and a great restaurant The Keg about 5 minutes away.  I am blaming management and ownership from preventing this hotel from reaching it's maximum potential. Mostly ownership who won't provide the basic things a traveler may need. At the price point of this place we should have had a wonderful room with lights and the ability to buy food on sight. Sorry to say we will never go back to this hotel. Way to many inconveniences to stay again and not close enough to Toronto to make make it worth my while

The room did not appear to have been vacuumed well, there was a stain on the fitted sheet and the headboard was dirty. There were small pieces of hair (shaved?), I assume from a previous guest, on the coasters in the bathroom that the water glasses were placed on, and the bathroom sink was not completely clean.

The was only 1 giant king bed and a pull out couch. Again, we had 5 people. Granted most pull out couches are a bit rough but in this case I truly believe that the floor would have been softer. And finally, the next morning the toilet wouldn't flush. We again called the front desk. They tried to fix the issue and we were told they were going to have to pull the toilet.

Called front desk for paper cups, face towel, hand towel, bath towel. I did not get the face towel or hand towel. 2. Called front desk for tea and coffee cups. He only brought the cups, not the tea. First of all it took me more than 10 minutes to get a hold of the front desk. Called several times, no answer at 6:50pm. 3. Called housekeeping for toilet paper because I was concerned we may run out during the night (I should not have to call housekeeping for toilet paper, they should always leave an extra one on hand). 4. Another occasion, housekeeping left two disposable coffee cups, but only one lid. 5. Did not have linens and pillows for the pull-out sofa bed. Called the front desk at 11:55pm, he said he would bring them up. After 10 minutes I had to call again, he told me they were very busy (really at 11:55pm). 6. The pull-out sofa bed is crappy and makes a lot of squeaky noise every time you turn or move, uncomfortable, no firm support at all. 7. Fitness Centre unclean, both containers of wipe sanitizers were empty during one of my workout, sweat stain on equipments, tight space, but has everything you need for a workout. 8. I was skeptical to use the pool area because it looked unsanitized to me. On one occasion the washroom in the pool area was filthy, smell like urine, two dirty & wet towels on the floor, no toilet paper in the washroom stall. This was at 8:30am. I opted using the washroom or the shower in the pool area because I was disgusted by what I saw. 9. In the suite, noticed puddles of water in the cupboard below the sink. There is a leak somewhere. 10.The telephone wire in the bedroom is very loose/broken and needs to be changed. It kept coming out when I would use the phone. 11. Humid in the room, damp, carpet smells unpleasant. Occupied a junior suite, spacious for small family, queen bed, pull out sofa, small fridge, microwave, kettle, coffee maker, work desk, separate bedroom and living space with a sliding door, sofa chairs in living room and bedroom, tv in living room and bedroom.

Standing in line for that long is too much for us oldies, so we skipped that.   Next time, if it's affordable we would stay downtown, but if not, we would return to the Edward Village. .",4,positive
